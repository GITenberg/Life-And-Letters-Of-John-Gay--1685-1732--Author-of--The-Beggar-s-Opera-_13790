    <p>
      John Gay was a considerable figure in the literary and social circles of his day. He was loved by Pope; Swift cared for him more than for any other man, and the letter in which Pope conveyed to
      him the sad tidings of Gay's death bears the endorsement: "On my dear friend Mr. Gay's death. Received December 15th [1732], but not read till the 20th, by an impulse foreboding some
      misfortune." Gay was on intimate terms with Arbuthnot and Lord Burlington, and Henrietta Howard, Lady Suffolk, was devoted to him and consulted him in the matter of her matrimonial troubles. He
      was the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry. His "Fables" and "The Beggar's Opera" have become classics; his play "Polly" made history. Though he persistently
      regarded himself as neglected by the gods, it is nevertheless a fact that the fates were unusually kind to him. A Cabinet Minister made him a present of South Sea stock; Walpole appointed him a
      Commissioner of Lotteries; he was granted an apartment in Whitehall; Queen Caroline offered him a sinecure post in her Household. Because he thought Gay ill-used, the greatest man of letters of
      the century quarrelled with Lady Suffolk; for the same reason a Duchess insulted the King and wiped the dust of the Court from her shoes, and a Duke threw up his employment under the <span
      class="newpage"><a name='Pageviii'>[pg viii]</a></span>Crown. All his friends placed their purses and their houses at Gay's disposal, and competed for the pleasure of his company. Never was there
      a man of letters so petted and pampered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is somewhat strange that there should be no biography of a man so well-known and so much beloved. It is true that no sooner was the breath out of his body than Curll published a "Life."
      "Curll (who is one of the new horrors of death) has been writing letters to everybody for memoirs of his (Gay's) life," Arbuthnot wrote to Swift, January 13th, 1733: "I was for sending him
      some, which I am sure might have been made entertaining, by which I should have attained two ends at once, published truth and got a rascal whipped for it. I was over-ruled in this."<a name=
      'FNanchor_1_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Curll obtained no assistance from Gay's friends, and his book, issued in 1733, is at once inadequate and unreliable. Of Curll, at
      whose hands so many of Gay's friends had suffered, the poet had written in the "Epistle to the Right Honourable Paul Methuen, Esquire":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Were Prior, Congreve, Swift, and Pope unknown,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Poor slander-selling Curll would be undone.</span><br />

    <p>
      Of some slight biographical value is the "Account of the Life and Writings of the Author," prefixed to the volume of "Plays Written by Mr. Gay," published 1760; but there is little fresh
      information in the "Brief Memoir" by the Rev. William (afterwards Archdeacon) Coxe, which appeared in 1797. More valuable is the biographical sketch by Gay's nephew, the Rev. Joseph Baller,
      prefixed to "Gay's Chair" (1820); but the standard authorities on Gay's life are <span class="newpage"><a name='Pageix'>[pg ix]</a></span>Mr. Austin Dobson ("Dictionary of National Biography,"
      Vol. XXI., 1890) and Mr. John Underwood ("Introductory Memoir" to the "Poems of John Gay" in the "Muses' Library," 1893).
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Gay's correspondents were Pope, Swift, Lady Suffolk, Arbuthnot, the Duchess of Queensberry, Oxford, Congreve, Parnell, Cleland, Caryll and Jacob Tonson, the publisher. Unpublished letters
      to Caryll and Tonson, and to and from Lady Suffolk, are in the British Museum; letters which have appeared in print are to be found in the correspondence of Pope, Swift, and Lady Suffolk, in
      Nichols' "Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century," and in the Historical Commission's Report on the MSS. of the Marquis of Bath. Biographical information is also to be found, as well as
      in the works mentioned above, in Gribble's "Memorials of Barnstaple," Mrs. Delany's "Autobiography," Hervey's "Memoirs," Colley Cibber's "Apology," and Spence's "Anecdotes"; in the works and
      biographies of Pope, Swift, Steele, Addison, and Aaron Hill; in contemporary publications such as "A Key to 'The What D'ye Call It,'" "A Complete Key to the New Farce 'Three Hours After
      Marriage,'" Joseph Gay's "The Confederates"; and in numerous works dealing with dramatic productions and dramatic literature. A bibliography is printed in the "Cambridge History of English
      Literature" (Vol. IX., pp. 480-481; 1912); and a more detailed bibliography is being compiled by Mr. Ernest L. Gay, Boston, Mass., U.S.A., who has informed the present writer that he "has
      collected about five hundred editions of Gay's works, and also over five hundred playbills of his plays, running from the middle of the eighteenth century <span class="newpage"><a name='Pagex'>
      [pg x]</a></span>to the middle of the nineteenth century." The most valuable criticisms of Gay as a man of letters are by Johnson in the "Lives of the Poets" and Thackeray in the "English
      Humourists of the Eighteenth Century." An interesting article on Gay by Mr. H.M. Paull appeared in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, June, 1912.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am much indebted for assistance given to me during the preparation of this work by Sydney Harper, Esq., of Barnstaple, the happy possessor of Gay's chair; Professor J. Douglas Brude, of the
      University of Tennessee; C.J. Stammers, Esq.; and Ernest L. Gay, Esq., of Boston, Mass., U.S.A. I am especially grateful to W.H. Grattan Flood, Esq., Mus.D., who has generously sent me his
      notes on the sources of the tunes in "The Beggar's Opera," which are printed in the Appendix to this volume. The extracts from Gay's poetical works in this volume have been taken, by permission
      of the publishers, Messrs. George Routledge and Sons, Ltd., from the "Poems of John Gay," edited by Mr. John Underwood, in "The Muses' Library." Mr. John Murray has kindly allowed me to quote
      correspondence to and from Gay printed in the standard edition of Pope's works, edited by the late Rev. Whitwell Elwin and Professor Courthope, and published by him.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1685-1706<br />
       EARLY YEARS
    </h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      The Gays were an old family, who settled in Devonshire when Gilbert le Gay, through his marriage with the daughter and heiress of Curtoyse, came into possession of the manor of Goldsworthy, in
      Parkham. This they held until 1630, when it passed out of their hands to the Coffins.<a name='FNanchor_1_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_2'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Subsequently they were associated with
      the parish of Frittelstock, near Great Torrington. In the Parish Registers of Barnstaple the name appears from time to time: in 1544 is recorded the death of Richard Gaye, and later of John
      Gaye, "gentill man," and Johans Gay. From other sources it is known that Richard Gay was Mayor of the town in 1533, and Anthony Gay in 1638.<a name='FNanchor_2_3'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_2_3'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The records of the family have not been preserved, but at some time early in the seventeenth century there was at Frittelstock one John Gay, whose second son,
      William, was the father of the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Gay resided at Barnstaple, and since he lived in a large house, called the Red Cross, at the corner of Joy Street, facing Holland Street, it is reasonable to assume that he was in easy
      circumstances. He married a daughter of Jonathan Hanmer, the leading Nonconformist divine of the town, and by her had five children. The first-born was a girl, who died in 1685; then came
      Katherine, born <span class="newpage"><a name='Page2'>[pg 2]</a></span>in 1676, who married Anthony Baller, whose son Joseph issued in 1820 the slim volume bearing the title of "Gay's Chair";<a
      name='FNanchor_3_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_4'><sup>[3]</sup></a>in 1778, Jonathan; and three years later, Joanna, who married John Fortescue&mdash;possibly a relation of William Fortescue,
      afterwards Master of the Rolls, who is still remembered as a friend of Pope. The youngest child was John, the subject of this memoir, stated by his earlier biographers to have been born in
      1688, but now known, from an entry in the Barnstaple Parish Register, to have been baptised in the Old Church on September 16th, 1685.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gay died in 1694, her husband a year later; and the custody of the four surviving orphaned children devolved upon their uncles. William Gay's brothers were John and Richard, who resided at
      Frittelstock; James, Rector of Meeth; and Thomas, who lived at Barnstaple. Mrs. Gay's only brother was John Hanmer, who succeeded to his father's pastoral office among the Congregational or
      Independent Dissenters at Barnstaple. Jonathan, the elder son of William Gay, who inherited the family property, was intended for the Church, but "severe studies not well suiting his natural
      genius, he betook himself to military pursuits,"<a name='FNanchor_4_5'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_5'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and, probably about the time of his father's death, entered the army. Who
      took charge of the two girls is not known; but it is on record that John, after his father's death, and then in his tenth year, went to live at Barnstaple with his paternal uncle, Thomas Gay.
      It is interesting to note that in 1882, "among the pieces of timber carted away from the Barnstaple Parish Church [which was then undergoing restoration] has been found a portion of a pew, with
      the name 'John Gay,' and the date, 1695, cut upon it.... No other John Gay appears in the Parish Register."<a name='FNanchor_5_6'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_6'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay attended the Free Grammar School at Barnstaple, and among his schoolfellows there with whom he cemented <span class="newpage"><a name='Page3'>[pg 3]</a></span>an enduring friendship, were
      William Fortescue, to whom reference has been made above, and Aaron Hill.<a name='FNanchor_6_7'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_7'><sup>[6]</sup></a> William Raynor was the headmaster when Gay first
      went to the Grammar School, but soon he removed to Tiverton, and was succeeded by the Rev. Robert Luck. Luck subsequently claimed that Gay's dramatic instincts were developed by taking part in
      the amateur theatricals promoted by him, and when in April, 1736, he published a volume of verse, he wrote, in his dedication to the Duke of Queensberry.<a name='FNanchor_7_8'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_7_8'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Gay's patron and friend:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>"O Queensberry! could happy Gay</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This offering to thee bring,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>''Tis he, my Lord' (he'd smiling say),</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Who taught your Gay to sing.'"</span><br />

    <p>
      These lines suggest that an intimacy between Gay and Luck existed long after their relations as pupil and master had ceased, but it is doubtful if this was the case. It is certainly improbable
      that the lad saw much of the pedagogue when he returned to Barnstaple for a while as the guest of the Rev. John Hanmer, since Luck was a bitter opponent of the Dissenters and in open antagonism
      to John Hanmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long Gay remained at the Grammar School is not known. There are, indeed, no records upon which to base a narrative of his early years. It is, however, generally accepted that, on leaving
      school, he was apprenticed to a silk-mercer in London. This was not so unaccountable a proceeding then as appears to-day, for we know from Gibbon's "Memoirs" that "our most respectable families
      have not disdained the counting-house, or even the shop;... and in England, as well as in the Italian commonwealths, heralds have been compelled to declare that gentility is not degraded by the
      exercise of trade": for example, the historian's great grandfather, son of a <span class="newpage"><a name='Page4'>[pg 4]</a></span>country gentleman, became a linen-draper in Leadenhall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay had no taste for trade, and did not long remain in this employment. According to one authority, "he grew so fond of reading and study that he frequently neglected to exert himself in
      putting oft silks and velvets to the ladies";<a name='FNanchor_8_9'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_9'><sup>[8]</sup></a> while his nephew, the Rev. Joseph Bailer, says: "Young Gay, not being able to
      bear the confinement of a shop, soon felt a remarkable depression of spirits, and consequent decline of health; he was, therefore, obliged to quit that situation, and retire to Barnstaple, in
      the hope of receiving benefit from his native air."<a name='FNanchor_9_10'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_10'><sup>[9]</sup></a> No doubt the mercer was willing enough to cancel the indentures of an
      apprentice so unsatisfactory as Gay probably was. Anyhow, Gay returned to Barnstaple, and stayed awhile with his maternal uncle, the Rev. John Hanmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that it was during this visit to Barnstaple that Gay began to write verses; and as most men who take to poetry began to dabble in ink in their youth, this statement may well be
      accepted. Only, so far no bibliographer has traced any of these early writings. Some poems, said to have been written by him in these days have been printed in the volume to which reference has
      already been made, "Gay's Chair: Poems never before printed, written by John Gay.... With a Sketch of his Life from the MSS. of the Rev. Joseph Bailer, his nephew. Edited by Henry Lee ...
      1820," but the authenticity of these cannot definitely be accepted. A chair, said to have been the property of Gay at Barnstaple, was sold early in the nineteenth century to Henry Lee, who sent
      it to be repaired. "On taking out the drawer in front, which was somewhat broken," so runs the story, "I found at the back part of the chair a concealed drawer, ingeniously fastened with a
      small wooden bolt;... it was full of manuscript papers, some of which appeared to have <span class="newpage"><a name='Page5'>[pg 5]</a></span>slipped over, as I found them stuck to the bottom or
      seat of the chair."<a name='FNanchor_10_11'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_11'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The poems in question are: "The Ladies' Petition to the Honorable the House of Commons," the
      longest and most ambitious of the pieces; "To Miss Jane Scott," "Prediction," "Comparisons," "Absence," "Fable," "Congratulation to a Newly-married Pair," "A Devonshire Hill," "Letter to a
      Young Lady," and "To My Chair." Of this small collection, Mr. John Underhill, who includes it in his admirable edition of Gay's poems in the "Muses' Library," writes: "The evidence in support
      of their authenticity is (1) the fact that they were found in a chair which was always spoken of by Gay's 'immediate descendants' as 'having been the property of the poet, and which, as his
      favourite easy chair, he highly valued'; and (2) that 'The Ladies' Petition' was printed nearly <i>verbatim</i> from a manuscript in the handwriting of the poet ... If really Gay's, they [the
      verses] may, we think, a great many of them, be safely regarded as the production of his youth, written, perhaps, during the somewhat extended visit to Devonshire which preceded his
      introduction to the literary world of Pope. The least doubtful piece, 'The Ladies' Petition' was probably 'thrown off' upon the occasion of his visit to Exeter in 1715."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the verses are genuine, they have such biographical interest as is afforded by an allusion to a youthful love-affair. There are lines "To Miss Jane Scott":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The Welsh girl is pretty.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>The English girl fair,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The Irish deem'd witty,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>The French <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i>;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Though all may invite me,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>I'd value them not;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The charms that delight me</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>I find in a SCOT.</span><br />

    <p>
      It is presumedly to the same young lady he was referring <span class="newpage"><a name='Page6'>[pg 6]</a></span>in the verses written probably shortly after he returned to London after his visit
      to Devonshire:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 6em;'>ABSENCE.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Augustus, frowning, gave command.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Ovid left his native land;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From Julia, as an exile sent.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He long with barb'rous Goths was pent.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So fortune frown'd on me, and I was driven</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From friends, from home, from Jane, and happy Devon!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Jane, sore grieved when from me torn away;&mdash;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>loved her sorrow, though I wish'd her&mdash;GAY.</span><br />

    <p>
      That another girl there was may be gathered from the "Letter to a Young Lady," who was not so devoted as Jane Scott, for the poet writes:
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Begging you will not mock his sighing.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And keep him thus whole years a-dying!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>"Whole years!"&mdash;Excuse my freely speaking.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Such tortures, why a month&mdash;a week in?</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Caress, or kill him quite in one day,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Obliging thus your servant, JOHN GAY.</span><br />
     <br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1706-1712<br />
       GAY COMMENCES AUTHOR
    </h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      Gay's health was improved by his stay in his native town, and presently he returned to London, where, according to the family tradition, he "lived for some time as a private gentleman."<a name=
      'FNanchor_1_12'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_12'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Mr. Austin Dobson has pointed out that this is "a statement scarcely reconcilable with the opening in life his friends had found
      for him";<a name='FNanchor_2_13'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_13'><sup>[2]</sup></a> but it may be urged against this view that Gay and his sisters had each a small patrimony.<a name=
      'FNanchor_3_14'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_14'><sup>[3]</sup></a> If it is assumed that he returned to the metropolis after he came of age in September, 1706, he may have been possessed of a sum
      of money, small, no doubt, but sufficient to provide him with the necessaries of life for some little time. When his brother, Jonathan, who had been promoted lieutenant at Cologne by
      Marlborough, under whom he served at Hochstadt and elsewhere, and captain by Queen Anne, committed suicide in 1709, after a quarrel with his colonel, John may have inherited some further share
      of the paternal estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gay was one-and-twenty, ginger was hot in his mouth. Wine, woman, and song appealed to him. It is not on record that he had any love-affair, save those indicated in the verses in "Gay's
      Chair"; but the indelicacy of many passages in his writings suggests that he was rather intimately acquainted with the bagnios of the town. No man whose sense of decency had not been denied
      could <span class="newpage"><a name='Page8'>[pg 8]</a></span>possibly have written the verses "To a Young Lady, with some Lamphreys," and this, even after making allowance for the freedom of the
      early eighteenth century. He certainly frequented the coffee-houses of Covent Garden and Pall Mall. Also, he roamed about the metropolis, and became learned in the highways and byways, north
      and south, and east and west&mdash;a knowledge which bore excellent fruit in "Trivia."
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But I, who ne'er was bless'd by Fortune's hand,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor brighten'd plough-shares in paternal land.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Long in the noisy town have been immured,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Respired its smoke, and all its cares endured.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where news and politics divide mankind,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And schemes of state involve th' uneasy mind.<a name='FNanchor_4_15'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_15'><sup>[4]</sup></a></span><br />

    <p>
      Gay was then, as ever, a great eater. "As the French philosopher used to prove his existence by <i>cogito, ergo sum</i>," Congreve wrote to Pope long after, "the greatest proof of Gay's
      existence is <i>edit, ergo est</i>."<a name='FNanchor_5_16'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_16'><sup>[5]</sup></a> He ate in excess always, and not infrequently drank too much, and for exercise had no
      liking, though he was not averse from a ramble around London streets. As the years passed, he became fat, but found comfort in the fact that some of his intimates were yet more corpulent. To
      this, he made humorous reference in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And wondering Maine so fat, with laughing eyes,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>(Gay, Maine and Cheney,<a name='FNanchor_6_17'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_17'><sup>[6]</sup></a> boon companions dear,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Gay fat, Maine fatter, and Cheney huge of size).</span><br />

    <p>
      Gay had a passion for finery. To this foible Pope, in the early days of his acquaintance with the young man, made reference in a letter to Swift, December 8th, 1713: "One Mr. Gay, an unhappy
      youth, who writes pastorals during the time of Divine Service, whose case is the more deplorable, as he hath miserably lavished away all that silver he should have reserved for his soul's
      health, in <span class="newpage"><a name='Page9'>[pg 9]</a></span>buttons and loops for his coat." Gay was not only well aware of this weakness, but he deplored it, though he could never contrive
      to overcome it. He made allusion to it in some lines known as the "Epigrammatical Petition," addressed to Lord Oxford,<a name='FNanchor_7_18'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_18'><sup>[7]</sup></a> in
      June, 1714, and also in the prologue to "The Shepherd's Week":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I sold my sheep and lambkins too,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>For silver loops and garments blue:</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>My boxen hautboy sweet of sound,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>For lace that edged mine hat around;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For Lightfoot and my scrip I got</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>A gorgeous sword, and eke a knot.</span><br />

    <p>
      Gay now renewed his acquaintance with his old schoolfellow, Aaron Hill, who, it is said, though on doubtful authority, employed him as an amanuensis when setting on foot the project of
      answering questions in a paper, styled the <i>British Apollo, or, Curious Amusements for the Ingenious</i>.<a name='FNanchor_8_19'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_19'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The first
      number of this publication appeared on March 13th, 1708, and it was issued on Wednesdays and Fridays until March 16th, 1711. Gay referred to it in his pamphlet, "The Present State of Wit,"
      published in May 1711: "Upon a review of my letter, I find I have quite forgotten the <i>British Apollo</i>, which might possibly have happened from its having of late retreated out of this end
      of the town into the country, where I am informed, however, that it still recommends itself by deciding wagers at cards and giving good advice to shopkeepers and their apprentices." Whether or
      no Gay ever contributed to the <i>British Apollo</i>, it seems likely that it was through the good offices of Hill that in May, 1708, Gay's poem, "Wine," was published by William Keble at the
      Black-Spread-eagle in Westminster Hall, who, about the same time, brought out a translation by Nahum Tate, the Poet Laureate, and Hill, of a portion of the thirteenth book of Ovid's
      "Metamorphoses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page10'>[pg 10]</a></span>Wine," a subject on which Gay, even at the age of twenty-two, could write with some authority, secured a sufficient popularity to be paid
      the doubtful compliment of piracy in 1709, by Henry Hill, of Blackfriars, on whom presently the author neatly revenged himself in his verses, "On a Miscellany of Poems to Bernard Lintott," by
      the following reference:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>While neat old Elzevir is reckon'd better</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Than Pirate Hill's brown sheets and scurvy letter.</span><br />

    <p>
      This blank-verse poem, which may have been suggested by John Philips' "Cider," published in 1708, is written in the mock-heroic strain, and although it has no particular value, shows some sense
      of humorous exaggeration, of which Gay was presently to show himself a master.
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of happiness terrestrial, and the source</span><br />

      So far as is known, Gay preserved a profound silence for three years after his publication of "Wine," and then, on May 3rd, 1711, appeared from his pen, "The Present State of Wit, in a Letter
      to a Friend in the Country," sold at the reasonable price of three-pence. This attracted the attention of Swift. "Dr. Freind<a name='FNanchor_9_20'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_9_20'><sup>[9]</sup></a> ... pulled out a two-penny pamphlet just published, called 'The State of Wit', giving the characters of all the papers that have come out of late," he wrote
      in the "Journal to Stella," May 12: "The author seems to be a Whig, yet he speaks very highly of a paper called the <i>Examiner</i>, and says the supposed author of it is Dr. Swift. But, above
      all things, he praises the <i>Tatlers</i> and <i>Spectators</i>, and I believe Steele and Addison were privy to the printing of it. Thus is one treated by the impudent dogs." In this
      unambitious little sketch, as the author puts it, he gives "the histories and characters of all our periodical papers, whether monthly, weekly or diurnal," and it is, therefore, of value to the
      student of the early days of English journalism. He claimed to write without political bias: "I shall only promise that, as you know, I never cared one farthing either for Whig or Tory, so I
      shall consider our writers purely as they are such, without any respect to which party they belong." In "The Present State of Wit" most of the better-known periodical writers are introduced.
      Dr. William King is mentioned, not he who was the Archbishop of Dublin, nor he who was the Principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford, but he of whom it was said that he "could write verses in a tavern
      three hours after he could not speak," who was the author of the "Art of Cookery" and the "Art of Love," and <span class="newpage"><a name='Page12'>[pg 12]</a></span>who in 1709 had fluttered the
      scientific dovecotes by parodying the "Philosophical Transactions" in the <i>Useful Transactions in Philosophy and Other Sorts of Learning</i>, of which, however, only three numbers were
      issued. John Ozell was pilloried as the author of the <i>Monthly Amusement</i>, which was not, as the title suggests, a periodical, but was merely a title invented to summarise his frequent
      appearances in print. "It is generally some French novel or play, indifferently translated, it is more or less taken notice of, as the original piece is more or less agreeable." Defoe takes his
      place in the gallery as the editor and principal contributor to the weekly <i>Poor Review</i>, that is, the <i>Weekly Review</i> (which was published weekly from February 19th, 1704, until
      1712) which, says Gay, "is quite exhausted and grown so very contemptible, that though he has provoked all his brothers of the quill round, none of them will enter into a controversy with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The periodical publications of the day are passed under review: the <i>Observer</i>, founded in 1702 by John Tutchin, and after his death five years later, conducted by George Ridpath, editor
      of the <i>Flying Post</i>, until 1712, when it had almost entirely ceased to please, and was finally extinguished by the Stamp Tax; the weekly <i>Examiner</i>, set up in August, 1710, in
      opposition to the Whig <i>Taller</i>, numbering among its contributors Dr. King, St. John, Prior, Atterbury, and Freind, and managed by Swift from No. 14 (October 26th, 1710); the <i>Whig
      Examiner</i>, the first issue of which appeared on September 14th, 1710, its five numbers being written by Addison; the <i>Medley</i>, another Whig paper, which ran from August, 1710, to
      August, 1711, and was edited by Arthur Mainwaring, with the assistance of Steele, Oldmixon, and Anthony Henley (a wit and a man of fortune, to whom Garth dedicated "The Dispensary," and who
      distinguished himself by describing Swift as "a beast for ever after the order of Melchisedec"). The <i>Tatter</i>, which appeared three times a week from April 12th, 1709, to January 2nd,
      1711, was of course mentioned, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page13'>[pg 13]</a></span>and well-deserved tributes were paid to Steele and Addison. Of Addison he wrote with appreciation, but
      briefly: "This is that excellent friend to whom Mr. Steele owes so much, and who refuses to have his pen set before those pieces which the greatest pens in England would be proud to own.
      Indeed, they could hardly add to this gentleman's reputation, whose works in Latin and English poetry long since convinced the world that he was the greatest master in Europe of those two
      languages." Of Steele, Gay wrote at greater length: "To give you my own thoughts of this gentleman's writings, I shall, in the first place, observe that there is a noble difference between him
      and all the rest of our polite and gallant authors. The latter have endeavoured to please the age by falling in with them, and encourage them in their fashionable views and false notion of
      things. It would have been a jest, some time since, for a man to have asserted that anything witty could be said in praise of a married state, or that devotion and virtue were any way necessary
      to the character of a fine gentleman. Bickerstaff ventured to tell the town that they were a parcel of fops, fools and coquettes; but in such a manner as even pleased them, and made them more
      than half-inclined to believe that he spoke truth. Instead of complying with the false sentiments and vicious tastes of the age&mdash;either in morality, criticism, or good breeding&mdash;he
      has boldly assured them that they were altogether in the wrong; and commanded them, with an authority which perfectly well became him, to surrender themselves to his arguments for virtue and
      good sense. It is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the town; how many thousand follies they have either quite banished, or given a very great check to! how much
      countenance they have added to virtue and religion! how many people they have rendered happy, by showing them it was their own fault if they were not so! and, lastly, how entirely they have
      convinced our young fops and young fellows of the value and advantages <span class="newpage"><a name='Page14'>[pg 14]</a></span>of learning! He has indeed rescued it out of the hands of pedants
      and fools, and discovered the true method of making it amicable and lovely to all mankind. In the dress he gives it, it is a welcome guest at tea-tables and assemblies, and is relished and
      caressed by the merchants on the 'Change. Accordingly there is not a lady at Court, nor a banker in Lombard Street who is not verily persuaded that Captain Steele is the greatest scholar and
      best casuist of any man in England. Lastly, his writings have set all our wits and men of letters on a new way of thinking, of which they had little or no notion before: and, although we cannot
      say that any of them have come up to the beauties of the original, I think we may venture to affirm, that every one of them writes and thinks much more justly than they did some time since."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay's agreeable personality secured him many friends. Not later than the spring of 1711 he made the acquaintance of Henry Cromwell, whom he later described as "the honest hatless Cromwell with
      red breeches," by whom he was introduced to Pope, who was at this time a member of Addison's circle, and generally recognised as a rising man of letters. Pope evidently liked Gay, who was his
      senior by nearly three years, but was as a child in worldly wisdom. On July 15th, 1711, Pope wrote to Cromwell, "Pray give my service to all my friends, and to Mr. Gay in particular";<a name=
      'FNanchor_10_21'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_21'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and again, nine days later, addressing the same correspondent, he said: "My humble services, too, to Mr. Gay, of whose paper
      ['The Present State of Wit'] I have made mention to [Erasmus] Lewis."<a name='FNanchor_11_22'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_22'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Gay, ever anxious to please those whom he liked
      and, perhaps, especially those who might be of use to him, when writing the verses, "On a Miscellany of Poems to Bernard Lintott" (which appeared in that publisher's <i>Miscellany</i> issued in
      May, 1712), eagerly took advantage to ingratiate himself with a number of people, in so far as he could do this <span class="newpage"><a name='Page15'>[pg 15]</a></span>by means of compliments.
      Gay tells the publisher that if he will only choose his authors from "the successful bards" praised by the author, then "praise with profit shall reward thy pains"; and&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So long shall live thy praise in books of fame,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Tonson yield to Lintott's lofty name;</span><br />

    <p>
      but, since an author should not praise one publisher at the expense of another, he has already had a kindly word for that more celebrated publisher, Jacob Tonson&mdash;"Jacob's mighty name." It
      may be mentioned in passing that Gay's "Poems on Several Occasions" bear the joint imprint of Lintott and Tonson. Gay waxed eloquent in these verses, when writing of the other contributors to
      the <i>Miscellany</i>, and bestowed praise upon his brother-poets in no measured quantity:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where Buckingham will condescend to give</span><br />

      It was in reference to these complimentary lines (which Pope saw in manuscript) that, on December 21st, 1711, Pope wrote to Cromwell: "I will willingly return Mr. Gay my thanks for the favour
      of his poem, and in particular for his kind mention of me."<a name='FNanchor_14_25'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_25'><sup>[14]</sup></a> That letter is interesting also as being the last exchanged
      between Pope and his old friend; and it is instructive, as showing how the acquaintance between the poets was already ripening, that Pope turned to Gay in his distress at the defection of his
      earlier friend. "Our friend, Mr. Cromwell, too, has been silent all this year. I believe he has been displeased at some or other of my freedoms, which I very innocently take, and most with
      those I think my friends," he wrote to Gay on November 13th, 1712. "But this I know nothing of; perhaps he may have opened to you, and if I know you right, you are of a temper to cement
      friendships, and not to divide them. I really very much love Mr. Cromwell, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page17'>[pg 17]</a></span>and have a true affection for yourself, which, if I had any
      interest in the world, or power with those who have, I should not be long without manifesting to you."<a name='FNanchor_15_26'></a><a href='#Footnote_15_26'><sup>[15]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If Pope had lost the friendship of Henry Cromwell, he was certainly anxious to strengthen the bond that was beginning to be forged between himself and Gay, to whom he wrote again: "I desire you
      will not, either out of modesty, or a vicious distrust of another's value for you&mdash;those two eternal foes to merit&mdash;imagine that your letters and conversation are not always welcome
      to me. There is no man more entirely fond of good-nature or ingenuity than myself, and I have seen too much of these qualities in Mr. Gay to be anything less than his most affectionate friend
      and real servant."<a name='FNanchor_16_27'></a><a href='#Footnote_16_27'><sup>[16]</sup></a> That the intimacy between the poets waxed apace is evident, for when Pope wrote "A Farewell to
      London in the year 1715," the concluding stanza was:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Adieu to all but Gay alone.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Whose soul, sincere and free.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Loves all mankind, but flatters none.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And so may starve with me.</span><br />

      There has been preserved a letter written by Aaron Hill to Richard Savage, June 23rd, 1766, which contains information concerning the life of the poet during the next two years. "I would
      willingly satisfy the curiosity of your friend, in relation to Mr. Gay, if it were not easy to get much further information than I am able to give, from Mr. Budgell or Mr. Pope; to the first of
      whom, the beginning of his life was best known, and to the last, its afternoon and evening," Hill wrote. "As to your question, whether Mr. Gay was ever a domestic of the Duchess of Monmouth, I
      can answer it in the affirmative; he was her secretary about the year 1713, and continued so, till he went over to Hanover, in the beginning of the following year, with Lord Clarendon, who was
      sent thither by Queen Anne. At his return, upon the death of that Queen, all his hopes became withered, but Mr. Pope (who you know, is an excellent planter) revived and invigorated his bays,
      and indeed, very generously supported him, in some more <i>solid</i> improvements; for remember a letter, wherein he invited him, with a very impoetical warmth that, so long as he himself had a
      shilling, Mr. Gay should be welcome to sixpence of it, nay, to eightpence, if he could but contrive to live on a groat."<a name='FNanchor_1_28'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_28'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now happily possible to elaborate the information given in this letter. Owing to the kindly offices of one or other of his friends, Gay had secured the appointment of domestic secretary
      to the Duchess of <span class="newpage"><a name='Page19'>[pg 19]</a></span>Monmouth. Anne Scott, Duchess of Buccleuch in her own right, had in 1663 married the Duke of Monmouth. He was executed
      for high treason in 1683, and three years later his widow married Charles, third Baron Cornwallis. Though she had not long mourned her first husband, she did not forget that he was on his
      father's side of the blood royal, and to the end of her days she preserved a regal state, which, however, did not make her unpopular at Court. "The Princess," wrote Lady Cowper, "loved her
      mightily, and certainly no woman of her years ever deserved it so well. She had all the life and fire of youth, and it was marvellous to see that the many afflictions she had suffered had not
      touched her wit and good nature, but at upwards of three-score she had both in their full perfection." Upon this appointment Dr. Johnson commented: "By quitting a shop for such service Gay
      might gain leisure, but he certainly advanced little on the boast of independence." As has been seen, however, there was an interval of several years between Gay's apprenticeship and his taking
      up this position as the Duchess's amanuensis&mdash;for it is doubtful if he ever attained to an office more responsible than this&mdash;he secured board and lodging, a little pocket money, and
      no doubt ample leisure. It was necessary for Gay to earn his livelihood, for he had spent his patrimony, and the earnings of his pen were as yet negligible. Indeed, the situation was almost
      ideal for an impecunious young man of letters. Anyhow, Gay was delighted, and Pope not less so. "It has been my good fortune within this month past to hear more things that have pleased me
      than, I think, in all my time besides," Pope wrote to Gay, December 24th, 1712; "but nothing, upon my word, has been so homefelt a satisfaction as the news you tell me of yourself; and you are
      not in the least mistaken when you congratulate me upon your own good success, for I have more people out of whom to be happy, than any ill-natured man can boast of." Pope, now well aware of
      Gay's natural indolence, was careful <span class="newpage"><a name='Page20'>[pg 20]</a></span>in this same letter to urge him to devote himself to literary labours in his leisure hours. "I shall
      see you this winter with much greater pleasure than I could the last, and I hope as much of your time as your Duchess will allow you to spare to any friend will not be thought lost upon one who
      is as much so as any man," he added. "I must also put you in mind, though you are now secretary to this lady, you are likewise secretary to nine other ladies, and are to write sometimes for
      them too. He who is forced to live wholly upon those ladies' favours is indeed in as precarious a condition as any who does what Chaucer says for subsistence; but they are very agreeable
      companions, like other ladies, when a man only passes a night or so with them at his leisure, and away."<a name='FNanchor_2_29'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_29'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay, the most amiable of men, never resented advice, perhaps because he so rarely followed it. In this case, however, he was surprisingly amenable. During the short time he was in the service
      of the Duchess of Monmouth, he drove his quill with some assiduity, and, indeed, at this period of his life he, who was presently distinguished as the laziest of men, worked diligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining the household of the Duchess, he had written "Rural Sports: A Georgic," and this was published on January 13th, 1713, by Jacob Tonson, with an inscription to Pope:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>You, who the sweets of rural life have known,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Despise th' ungrateful hurry of the town;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In Windsor groves your easy hours employ,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And, undisturb'd, yourself and Muse enjoy.</span><br />

    <p>
      During 1713 Gay wrote such trifles as papers on "Reproof and Flattery," and "Dress," which were printed in the <i>Guardian</i> on March 24th and September 21st respectively; and some verses,
      "Panthea," "Araminta," "A Thought on Eternity," and "A Contemplation on Night," which appeared in Steele's "Poetical Miscellany." A more ambitious work was "The Fan," which had <span class=
      "newpage"><a name='Page21'>[pg 21]</a></span>occupied him during the earlier part of the year. He was greatly interested in its composition, and corresponded with Pope while it was being written.
      "I am very much recreated and refreshed with the news of the advancement of 'The Fan,' which I doubt not will delight the eye and sense of the fair, as long as that agreeable machine shall play
      in the hands of posterity," Pope wrote to him, August 23rd, 1713: "I am glad your Fan is mounted so soon, but I would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure, and polish the sticks as
      much as you can. You may then cause it to be borne in the hands of both sexes, no less in Britain than it is in China, where it is ordinary for a mandarin to fan himself cool after a debate,
      and a statesman to hide his face with it when he tells a grave lie."<a name='FNanchor_3_30'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_30'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Again, on October 23rd, Pope wrote: "I shall go into
      the country about a month hence, and shall then desire to take along with me your poem of 'The Fan.'" The most ambitious as yet of Gay's writings, there are few to-day, however, who will
      question the judgment of Mr. Austin Dobson, "one of his least successful efforts, and, though touched by Pope, now unreadable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay had thus early a leaning to the theatre, where presently he was to score one of his greatest successes, and he wrote "The Wife of Bath," which was produced at Drury Lane on May 12th, 1713.
      Steele gave it a "puff preliminary" in No. 50 of the <i>Guardian</i> (May 8th).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay was now become known as a man of letters, and had made many friends. Johnson says: "Gay was the general favourite of the whole association of wits; but they regarded him as a playfellow
      rather than as a partner, and treated him with more fondness than respect."<a name='FNanchor_4_31'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_31'><sup>[4]</sup></a> There is some truth in this view, but of the
      affection he inspired there is no doubt. To know him was to love him. Wherein exactly lay his charm it is not easy now to say; but his gentle good-nature and his utter helplessness seems <span
      class="newpage"><a name='Page22'>[pg 22]</a></span>to have appealed to those of sterner mould. The extracts already given from Pope's correspondence show the affection with which he was inspired
      for his brother of the pen. Pope took him so completely under his massive wing that he remarked later, "they would call him one of my <i>&eacute;leves</i>."<a name='FNanchor_5_32'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_5_32'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Pope accepted the position, and introduced him to his circle. He made him known to Swift, and that great man loved him as he loved no other man; and to
      Parnell, Arbuthnot, Ford&mdash;the "joyous Ford" of "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece"&mdash;and Bolingbroke, in all of whom he inspired an affection, which endured through life. Parnell and Pope
      wrote jointly to him, and while in 1714 Pope was still addressing him as "Dear Mr. Gay," Parnell had already thrown aside all formality and greeted him as "Dear Gay." His old schoolfellow,
      William Fortescue, cleaved to him, and they were in such constant communication that when Pope wanted to see Fortescue, it was to Gay he appealed to arrange a meeting. The terms on which Gay
      was with the set is shown in Pope's letter to him, written from Binfield, May 4th, 1714: "Pray give, with the utmost fidelity and esteem, my hearty service to the Dean, Dr. Arbuthnot, Mr. Ford,
      and to Mr. Fortescue. Let them also know at Button's that I am mindful of them."<a name='FNanchor_6_33'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_33'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Erasmus Lewis Gay knew now, and Caryll
      too, and the rest of the small literary set, who, with gusto, made him welcome among them. Indeed, when the "Memoirs of Scriblerus" were in contemplation, and, indeed, begun in 1713, Gay, then
      comparatively unknown, was invited to take a hand in the composition with the greatest men of the day. "The design of the Memoirs of Scriblerus was to have ridiculed all the false tastes in
      learning, under a character of a man of capacity enough, that had dipped into every art and science, but injudiciously in each," we have been told. "It was begun by a club of some of the
      greatest wits of the age. Lord Oxford, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page23'>[pg 23]</a></span>the Bishop of Rochester, Mr. Pope, Congreve, Arbuthnot, Swift, and others. Gay often held the pen;
      and Addison liked it well enough, and was not disinclined to come in to it."<a name='FNanchor_7_34'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_34'><sup>[7]</sup></a> It does not transpire whether Gay had at this
      time met Swift, but that soon after they were in correspondence, appears from a letter from Pope to Swift, June 18th, 1714: "I shall translate Homer by the by. Mr. Gay has acquainted you with
      what progress I have made in it. I cannot name Mr. Gay without all the acknowledgments which I shall owe you, on his account."<a name='FNanchor_8_35'></a><a href=

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1714<br />
       "THE SHEPHERD'S WEEK," "A LETTER TO A LADY."
    </h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      The outstanding literary event in Gay's career in 1714 was the pastoral, "The Shepherd's Week," which was published by R. Burleigh on April 15th, which contained a "Proeme to the Courteous
      Reader," and a "Prologue to the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Bolingbroke," which was, in fact, a dedication:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Lo, I who erst beneath a tree</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Sung Bumkinet and Bowzybee,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Blouzelind and Marian bright,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In apron blue or apron white,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Now write my sonnets in a book,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For my good lord of Bolingbroke.</span><br />

    <p>
      The author then states that he had heard of the Queen's illness and how the skill of Arbuthnot had restored her to health:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>A skilful leech (so God him speed)</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>They said had wrought this blessed deed,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>This leech Arbuthnot was yclept,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who many a night not once had slept;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But watch'd our gracious Sov'reign still:</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For who could rest when she was ill?</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>O may'st thou henceforth sweetly sleep!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Shear, swains, oh shear your softest sheep</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To swell his couch; for well I ween,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>He saved the realm who saved his Queen.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Quoth I, please God, I'll his with glee</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To court, this Arbuthnot to see.</span><br />

    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name='Page25'>[pg 25]</a></span>Such loyalty, of course, the hardest heart must touch, but loyalty in this case had its reward, and the journey to Court was well worth the
      pains:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>There saw I ladies all a-row</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Before their Queen in seemly show.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>No more I'll sing Buxoma brown,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Like goldfinch in her Sunday gown;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor Clumsilis, nor Marian bright,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor damsel that Hobnelia hight.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But Lansdown fresh as flowers of May,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Berkely lady blithe and gay,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Anglesea, whose speech exceeds</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The voice of pipe or oaten reeds;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And blooming Hyde, with eyes so rare,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Montague beyond compare.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Such ladies fair wou'd I depaint</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In roundelay or sonnet quaint.</span><br />

    <p>
      But charming as were these ladies, there was still a better sight in store for the visitor:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>There saw I St. John, sweet of mien.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Full steadfast both to Church and Queen.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With whose fair name I'll deck my strain,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>St. John, right courteous to the swain.</span><br />
     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>For thus he told me on a day,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Trim are thy sonnets, gentle Gay,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And certes, mirth it were to see</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Thy joyous madrigals twice three,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With preface meet and notes profound.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Imprinted fair, and well y-bound.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>All suddenly then home I sped,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And did ev'n as my Lord had said.</span><br />

    <p>
      It was not Bolingbroke who inspired the pastorals, though he accepted the dedication. The true history of the origin of "The Shepherd's Week" is well set out by Mr. Underhill. "These pastorals,
      it should be explained, were written at the instigation of Pope," he has written. "The sixth volume of Tonson's 'Miscellany' had concluded with Pope's Pastorals and begun with those of Ambrose
      Philips. A few years after its publication a <span class="newpage"><a name='Page26'>[pg 26]</a></span>writer in the <i>Guardian</i><a name='FNanchor_1_36'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_1_36'><sup>[1]</sup></a> (probably Tickell<a name='FNanchor_2_37'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_37'><sup>[2]</sup></a>) discussed the Pastoral in a series of papers, and gave the most
      extravagant praise to Philips. 'Theocritus,' he remarked, 'left his dominions to Virgil; Virgil left his to his son Spenser; and Spenser was succeeded by his eldest born, Philips.' Pope was not
      mentioned, and he set himself to redress the injustice by a device of characteristic subtlety. He wrote a sixth paper, in which he continued to illustrate the true principles of pastoral poetry
      from Philips' practice, but in such a way as to show the judicious reader by the examples given either the absurdity of Philips or the superior merit of Pope. The article was anonymously or
      pseudonymously forwarded to the <i>Guardian</i>, and was in due course published. Philips was furious, and providing himself with a birch rod, threatened to flog Pope. The latter, not content
      with his ingenious revenge, prevailed upon his friend Gay to continue the warfare and to burlesque Philips' performances in a series of realistic representations of country life."<a name=
      'FNanchor_3_38'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_38'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Gay entered into the sport with joy&mdash;it was a game after his own heart, and one for which his talent was particularly
      fitted. He begins his "Proeme to the Gentle Reader" with a most palpable hit: "Great marvel hath it been (and that not unworthily) to diverse worthy wits, that in this our island of Britain, in
      all rare sciences so greatly abounding, more especially in all kinds of poesie highly flourishing, no poet (though other ways of notable cunning in roundelays) hath hit on the right simple
      eclogue after this true ancient guise of Theocritus, before this mine attempt. Other Poet travelling in this plain highway of Pastoral I know none." Presently comes an attack but little
      disguised on Philips: "Thou will not find my shepherdesses idly piping on oaten reeds, but milking the kine, tying up the sheaves, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page27'>[pg 27]</a></span>or if
      the hogs are astray driving them to their styes. My shepherd gathereth none other nosegays but what are the growth of our own fields, he sleepeth not under myrtle shades, but under a hedge, nor
      doth he vigilantly defend his flocks from wolves, because there are none, as maister Spenser well observeth:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Well is known that since the Saxon King</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Never was wolf seen, many or some,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor in all Kent nor in Christendom."</span><br />

    <p>
      Yet a third extract from this satirical "Proeme" must be given, and this in connection with the language of these eclogues: "That principally, courteous reader, whereof I would have thee to be
      advertised (seeing I depart from the vulgar usage) is touching the language of my shepherds; which is soothly to say, such as is neither spoken by the country maiden or the courtly dame; nay,
      not only such as in the present times is not uttered, but was never uttered in times past; and, if I judge aright, will never be uttered in times future. It having too much of the country to be
      fit for the court, too much of the court to be fit for the country; too much of the language of old times to be fit for the present, too much of the present to have been fit for the old, and
      too much of both to be fit for any time to come. Granted also it is, that in this my language, I seem unto myself, as a London mason, who calculateth his work for a term of years, when he
      buildeth with old material upon a ground-rent that is not his own, which soon turneth to rubbish and ruins. For this point, no reason can I allege, only deep learned examples having led me
      thereunto."
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is pretty fooling; but Gay, who in the beginning intended "The Shepherd's Week" to be merely a burlesque, according to the suggestion of Pope, was carried away by his interest in the
      subject-matter, and produced a poem of undoubted value as a picture of rural life in his own day. With it he won approval as an original poet in his own day, and three centuries after critics
      still write in praise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page28'>[pg 28]</a></span>These Pastorals were originally intended, I suppose, as a burlesque on those of Philips'; but, perhaps without designing it, Gay has hit
      the true spirit of pastoral poetry," Goldsmith said; and Dr. Johnson wrote: "The effect of reality of truth became conspicuous, even when the intention was to show them grovelling and degraded.
      These pastorals became popular, and were read with delight, as just representations of rural manners and occupations, by those who had no interest in the rivalry of the poets, nor knowledge of
      the critical disputes."<a name='FNanchor_4_39'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_39'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Southey, too, had a kind word to say: "In attempting the burlesque Gay copied nature, and his
      unexpected success might have taught his contemporaries a better taste. Few poets seem to have possessed so quick and observing an eye"<a name='FNanchor_5_40'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_5_40'><sup>[5]</sup></a>; and, coming to the present critics, Mr. Austin Dobson utters commendation: "The object went far beyond its avowed object of ridicule, and Gay's eclogues
      abound with interesting folk-lore and closely studied rural pictures."<a name='FNanchor_6_41'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_41'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his unworldliness Gay always had an eager, if not very keen, eye on the main chance, and finding himself surrounded by men of influence, he not unnaturally, in a day when men of
      letters often found their reward in Government places or in sinecures, looked to his acquaintances to further his interests. Great Britain was at this time represented at the Court of Hanover
      by a Mission which was from 1709 in charge of the Secretary, J. D'Alais, except when Special Missions were dispatched. Lord Rivers was Minister Plenipotentiary in 1710, and Thomas Harley went
      there as Ambassador Extraordinary in July, 1712, and again in the following February. Henry Paget, first Lord Burton, was appointed Ambassador in April, 1714, but resigned before he set forth,
      and Lord Clarendon was nominated in his stead.

        out, which he has promised me upon the following petition, which I sent him by Dr. Arbuthnot:&mdash;

      <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I'm no more to converse with the swains,</span><br />

       <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>But never without it at Court.</span><br />

      <p>
        We had the honour of the Treasurer's company last Saturday, when we sat upon Scriblerus. Pope is in town and has brought with him the first book of Homer. I am this evening to be at Mr.
        Lewis's with [Dr. Benjamin Pratt] the Provost [of Dublin College], Mr. Ford, Parnell, and Pope."

        "It is thought my Lord Clarendon will make but a short stay at Hanover. If it was possible that any recommendation could be procured to make me more distinguished than ordinary, during my
        stay at that Court, I should think myself very happy if you could contrive any method to prosecute it, for I am told that their civilities very rarely descend so low as to the Secretary. I
        have all the reason in the world to acknowledge this as wholly <span class="newpage"><a name='Page30'>[pg 30]</a></span>owing to you. And the many favours I have received from you, purely out of
        your love for doing good, assures me you will not forget me during my absence. As for myself, whether I am at home or abroad, gratitude will always put me in mind of the man to whom I owe so
        many benefits."<a name='FNanchor_7_42'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_42'><sup>[7]</sup></a>

    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      These tidings were confirmed to Swift by Arbuthnot, who wrote from St. James's on June 12th: "You know that Gay goes to Hanover, and my Lord Treasurer has promised to equip him. Monday is the
      day of departure, and he is now dancing attendance for money to buy him shoes, stockings, and linen. The Duchess [of Monmouth] has turned him off, which I am afraid will make the poor man's
      condition worse instead of better."<a name='FNanchor_8_43'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_43'><sup>[8]</sup></a> As Arbuthnot reported fourteen days later, Gay received a hundred pounds from the
      Treasury, and "went away a happy man."<a name='FNanchor_9_44'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_44'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Lord Clarendon, whose mission it was formally to offer to the Elector George Lewis
      the condolences of Queen Anne on the death of his aged mother, the Electress Sophia, the heiress-presumptive to the British throne, who had passed away on June 8th, 1714, arrived at Hanover on
      July 16th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Gay's forebodings, the civilities of the Court of Hanover did happily "descend so low as to the Secretary." That he was presented to the royal circle and held converse with the highest
      in the land, is clear from a sentence in a letter from Arbuthnot to Swift, August 13th, 1714: "I have a letter from Gay, just before the Queen's death. Is he not a true poet, who had not one of
      his own books to give to the Princess that asked for one?"<a name='FNanchor_10_45'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_45'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Here it was that Gay first made the acquaintance of
      Henrietta Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk, with whom he was presently on a footing of intimate friendship.

        "You remember, I suppose, that I was to write you abundance of letters from Hanover; but as one of the most distinguished qualities of a publician is secrecy, you must not expect from me any
        arcanas of state. There is another thing that is necessary to establish the character of a politician, which is to seem always to be full of affairs of State; to know the consultations of the
        Cabinet Council when at the same time his politics are collected from newspapers. Which of these two causes my secrecy is owing to I leave you to determine. There is yet one thing more that
        is extremely necessary for a foreign minister, which he can no more be without than an artisan without his tools; I mean the terms of his art. I call it an art or a science because I think
        the King of France has established an academy to instruct the young Machiavelians of his country in the deep and profound science of politics. To the end I might be qualified for an
        employment of this nature, and not only be qualified myself, but (to speak in the style of Sir John Falstaff) be the cause of qualification in others, I have made it my business to read
        memoirs, treatises, etc. And as a dictionary of law-terms is thought necessary for young beginners, so I thought a dictionary of terms of State would be no less useful for young politicians.
        The terms of politics being not so numerous as to swell into a volume, especially in times of peace (for in times of war all the terms of fortifications are included), I thought fit to
        extract them in the same manner for the benefit of young practitioners as a famous author has compiled his learned treatise of the law, called the 'Doctor and Student.' I have not made any
        great progress in this piece; but, however, I will give you a specimen of it, which will make you in the same manner a judge of the design and nature of this treatise.

    <p>
      Lord Clarendon stayed at Hanover even a shorter time than he had expected. On July 30th Lord Oxford was dismissed, and the white staff was given to the Duke of Shrewsbury, one of whose first
      acts was to recall the Tory Ambassador. Two days later Queen Anne died, and the Elector George Lewis succeeded to her throne under the style of George I. Lord Clarendon returned at once to
      England, and with him came Gay, saddened by the blasting of his hopes of advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was welcomed back by his friends, and received in particular an enthusiastic greeting from Pope, who wrote on September 23rd: "Welcome to your native soil! Welcome to your friend! Thrice
      welcome to me! whether returned in glory, blessed with Court interest, the love and familiarity of the great, and filled with agreeable hopes, or melancholy with dejection, contemplative of the
      changes of fortune, and doubtful for the future&mdash;whether returned a triumphant Whig or a desponding Tory, equally all hail! equally beloved and welcome to me! If happy, I am to share in
      your elevation; if unhappy, you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at Binfield in the worst of times at your service." In this same letter Pope, always anxious to assist Gay,
      added: "Pardon me if I add a word of advice in the practical way. Write something <span class="newpage"><a name='Page34'>[pg 34]</a></span>on the King, or Prince or Princess. On whatever foot you
      may be with the Court, this can do no harm."<a name='FNanchor_12_47'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_47'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      The change of Government having dashed to the ground his hopes of advancement in the diplomatic service, Gay thought that he could not do better than follow Pope's suggestion. Like the majority
      of men of letters of his day, and not having the independence of spirit of Swift and Pope, he hungered after a patron&mdash;a Minister might be good, but Ministers go out of office, and a
      member of the reigning family would be better. Remembering the kindly welcome given him at Hanover by the royal lady who was now Princess of Wales, he had indulged in a dream that a place would
      be offered him in her household. "Poor Gay is much where he was, only out of the Duchess [of Monmouth]'s family and service," Arbuthnot wrote to Swift, October 19th, 1714. "He has some
      confidence in the Princess and Countess of Picborough; I wish it may be significant to him. I advised him to make a poem upon the Princess before she came over, describing her to the English
      ladies; for it seems that the Princess does not dislike that. (She is really a person that I believe will give great content to everybody). But Gay was in such a grovelling condition as to the
      affairs of this world, that his Muse would not stoop to visit him."<a name='FNanchor_13_48'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_48'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      No proposal, however, being made to him, Gay, following the advice of Pope and Arbuthnot, proceeded to remind the new Court of his existence, and in November published "A Letter to a Lady,
      occasioned by the arrival of Her Royal Highness "&mdash;the "Lady" being, it is generally assumed, Mrs. Howard. In these verses he gave the assurance that he had desired the elements to arrange
      for the Princess an agreeable passage to England:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>My strains with Carolina's name I grace.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The lovely parent of our royal race.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Breathe soft, ye winds, ye waves in silence sleep;</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To waft her gently o'er the wat'ry way.</span><br />

    <p>
      With true poetic exaggeration he extolled Caroline's virtues, and then, so that there should be no excuse for misunderstanding, said in plain terms that he had desired a post at Court, and made
      it perfectly clear that he was still prepared to accept such employment, if so be as it was coupled with suitable remuneration:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Since all my schemes were baulk'd, my last resort,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I left the Muses to frequent the Court;</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And did the next day, and the next, the same.</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And yet no friendly <i>Gazette</i> mention'd Gay.</span><br />

    <p>
      Gay's protestations of delight at the accession to the throne of the House of Hanover would probably have been regarded as more sincere if, unfortunately, he had not a few months before
      dedicated "The Shepherd's Week" to Bolingbroke. His very outspoken hint in the "Letter to a Lady" was ignored; but Caroline, who liked eulogy as much as anyone, received him kindly; and when in
      February, 1715, he produced "The What D'ye Call It" at Drury Lane Theatre, she and her consort attended the first performance. But still, no place was found for him at Court. "Tell me," Swift
      asked him so much later as 1723, "are you not under original sin by the dedication of your Eclogue to Lord Bolingbroke?"

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1715-1719<br />
       "The What D'ye Call It"&mdash;An Epistle to the Right Honourable the<br />
       Earl of Burlington&mdash;"Trivia, or, The Art of Walking the Streets of<br />
       London"&mdash;"Three Hours After Marriage."
    </h3>
    <p>
      Undismayed by the failure of his first play, "The Wife of Bath," Gay made another bid for theatrical success with "The What D'ye Call It," which was performed at Drury Lane Theatre in February,
      1715, and published in March of that year. In the preface Gay wrote: "I have not called it a tragedy, comedy, pastoral, or farce, but left the name entirely undetermined in the doubtful
      appellation of 'The What D'ye Call It' ... but I added to it 'A Tragi-Comi-Pastoral Farce,' as it contained all these several kinds of drama." Pope saw the play and wrote about it to Congreve,
      March 19th, 1715: "The farce of 'The What D'ye Call It' has occasioned many different speculations in the town, some looking upon it as a mere jest upon the tragic poets, others as a satire
      upon the late war. Mr. Cromwell, hearing none of the words, and seeing the action to be tragical, was much astonished to find the audience laugh, and says the Prince and Princess [of Wales]
      must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account. Several Templars and others of the more vociferous kind of critics went with a resolution to hiss, and confessed they were forced
      to laugh so much that they forgot the design they came with. The Court in general has come in a very particular manner into the jest, and the three nights, notwithstanding two of them were
      Court <span class="newpage"><a name='Page37'>[pg 37]</a></span>nights, were distinguished by very full audiences of the first quality. The common people of the pit and gallery received it at first
      with great gravity and sedateness, and some few with tears; but after the third day they also took the hint, and have ever since been very loud in their claps. There are still sober men who
      cannot be of the general opinion, but the laughers are so much the majority that one or two critics seemed determined to undeceive the town at their proper cost, by writing dissertations
      against it to encourage them in this laudable design. It is resolved a preface shall be prefixed to the farce, in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing."<a name=
      'FNanchor_1_49'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_49'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The fact is that, as Johnson put it, "the images were comic and the action grave," and there were many mock-heroic passages which
      parodied tragedies, including Addison's "Cato" and Otway's "Venice Preserved," well-known in that day. Also it contained several ballads, of which perhaps the best is "'Twas when the seas were
      roaring" (Act II., Scene 8).
    </p>
    <p>
      "The What D'ye Call It" was not a piece of much value, but it pleased the audience, and Gay was highly delighted. "Now my benefit night is over, it should be my first care to return my thanks
      to those to whom I am mostly obliged, and the civilities I have always received from you, and upon this occasion too, claims this acknowledgment," the author wrote to Caryll on March 3rd: "'The
      What D'ye Call It' met with more success than could be expected from a thing so out of the common taste of the town. It has been played already five nights, and the galleries, who did not know
      at first what to make of it, now enter thoroughly into the humour, and it seems to please in general better than at first. The parts in general were not so well played as I could have wished,
      and in particular the part of Filbert, to speak in the style of the French Gazette. Penkethman did wonders; Mrs. Bicknell performed miraculously, and there was much honour gained <span class=
      "newpage"><a name='Page38'>[pg 38]</a></span>by Miss Younger, though she was but a parish child."<a name='FNanchor_2_50'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_50'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Filbert was played by
      Johnson, Jonas Dock by Penkethman, Joyce ("Peascod's daughter, left upon the parish") by Miss Younger, and Kitty by Mrs. Bicknell, mentioned by the author in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from
      Greece":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And frolic Bicknell, and her sister young.</span><br />

    <p>
      The welcome given by the public to the play brought in its train some annoyance to the author: "I find success, even in the most trivial things, raises the indignation of scribblers," he wrote
      to Parnell on March 18th, "for I, for my 'What D'ye Call It' could neither escape the fury of Mr. Burnet or the German doctor. Then, where will rage end when Homer is to be translated? Let
      Zoilus hasten to your friend's assistance, and envious criticism shall be no more."<a name='FNanchor_3_51'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_51'><sup>[3]</sup></a> A more biting attack than that of
      Thomas Burnet's <i>Grumbler</i> (No. 1, February 14th, 1715) or that of Philip Horneck in "The High German Doctor" was the "Key to 'The What D'ye Call It,'" written by the actor Griffin in
      collaboration with Lewis Theobald. About this Gay wrote to Caryll in April: "There is a sixpenny criticism lately published upon the tragedy of 'The What D'ye Call It,' wherein he with much
      judgment and learning calls me a blockhead and Mr. Pope a knave. His grand charge is against 'The Pilgrim's Progress' being read, which, he says, is directly levelled at Cato's reading Plato.
      To back this censure he goes on to tell you that 'The Pilgrim's Progress' being mentioned to be the eighth edition makes the reflection evident, the tragedy of 'Cato' being just eight times
      printed. He has also endeavoured to show that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of the tragedy, which he says I have injudiciously and profanely abused."<a name=
      'FNanchor_4_52'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_52'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Gay could really afford to laugh at those who attacked or parodied him, for the play brought him, if <span class="newpage"><a name='Page39'>[pg 39]</a></span>not fame, at least notoriety.
      It also brought him some much-needed money. Pope told Caryll in March that Gay "will have made about &pound;100 out of this farce"; and it is known that for the publishing rights Lintott gave
      him on February 14th &pound;16 2s. 6d.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay, now a popular dramatist as well as an intimate friend of many of the leading men in literary circles, became known to people of high social rank, who, like his brethren of the pen, took
      him up and made a pet of him. In the summer of 1715 Lord Burlington, the "generous Burlington" of "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece," invited him to accompany him to Devonshire, and Gay repaid
      the compliment by describing his "Visit to Exeter" in a poetical "Epistle to the Right Honourable the Earl of Burlington," the first lines of which are:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>While you, my Lord, bid stately piles ascend,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or in your Chiswick bowers enjoy your friend;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where Pope unloads the boughs within his reach,</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And, mounted, sent me forth your trusty squire.</span><br />

    <p>
      During his stay in Devonshire Gay began the composition of "Trivia, or The Art of Walking the Streets of London." It was to this that Pope made allusion when writing to Caryll, January 10th,
      1716: "Gay's poem [is] just on the brink of the press, which we have had the interest to procure him subscription of a guinea a book to a tolerable number. I believe it may be worth &pound;150
      to him on the whole."<a name='FNanchor_5_53'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_53'><sup>[5]</sup></a> In addition to the subscriptions, Gay received from Lintott &pound;43 for the copyright of the book,
      the copies of which were sold to the public at one shilling and sixpence each; and as, with humorous exaggeration, Arbuthnot wrote to Parnell: "Gay has got as much money by his 'Art of Walking
      the Streets' that he is ready to set up his equipage; he is just going to the bank to negotiate <span class="newpage"><a name='Page40'>[pg 40]</a></span>some exchange bills."<a name=
      'FNanchor_6_54'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_54'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The "Advertisement" prefaced to the poem runs:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world, I believe, will take so little notice of me that I need not take much of it. The critics may see by this poem that I walk on foot, which probably may save me from their envy. I
      should be sorry to raise that passion in men whom I am so much obliged to, since they allowed me an honour hitherto only shown to better writers: that of denying me to be author of my own
      works. I am sensible this must be done in pure generosity; because whoever writ them, provided they did not themselves, they are still in the same condition. Gentlemen, if there be any thing in
      this poem good enough to displease you, and if it be any advantage to you to ascribe it to some person of greater merit, I shall acquaint you for your comfort, that among many other
      obligations, I owe several hints of it to Dr. Swift. And if you will so far continue your favour as to write against it, I beg you to oblige me in accepting the following motto:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>&mdash;Non tu, in triviis, indocte, solebas</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen?"</span><br />

    <p>
      Whether Swift gave any direct assistance is doubtful. Mr. Austin Dobson thinks that it is not improbable that "Trivia" was actually suggested by the "Morning" and "City Shower" which Swift had
      previously contributed to Steele's <i>Tatler</i>. Probably these are among the "several hints" which Gay had in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trivia" was published on January 26th, 1716, and was the one outstanding feature in the year in the biography of Gay. In the following March 26th there appeared a volume of "Court Poems,"
      published by J. Roberts, who advertised them as from the pen of Pope, though the preface makes the authorship doubtful between Pope, Gay, and a Lady of quality, who was Lady Mary Wortley
      Montagu. To the volume Lady Mary Wortley Montagu contributed "The Drawing Room," Pope "The Basset <span class="newpage"><a name='Page41'>[pg 41]</a></span>Table," and Gay "The Toilet." This last
      has been attributed to Lady Mary, and it has actually been printed among her poems; but, according to Pope, it is "almost wholly Gay's," there being "only five or six lines in it by that lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1716 Gay paid a second visit to Devonshire, and during the year he composed the "sober eclogue," "The Espousal," which probably arose out of a suggestion of Swift. "There is an ingenious
      Quaker<a name='FNanchor_7_55'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_55'><sup>[7]</sup></a> in this town, who writes verses to his mistress, not very correct, but in a strain purely what a poetical Quaker
      should do, commending her looks and habit, etc." Swift wrote to Pope on August 30th, 1716: "It gave me a hint that a set of Quaker pastorals might succeed if our friend Gay could fancy it, and
      I think it a fruitful subject. Pray hear what he says. I believe farther, the pastoral ridicule is not exhausted, and that a porter, footman, or chairman's pastoral might do well; or what think
      you of a Newgate pastoral, among the whores and thieves there?"<a name='FNanchor_8_56'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_56'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This letter is of especial importance in the biography of
      Gay, as it may well have sown in his mind the seed of "The Beggar's Opera."
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Gay was labouring on another play, "Three Hours After Marriage," which he wrote in collaboration with Pope and Arbuthnot. It is a sorry piece of work, and unworthy of any one,
      much less of the three distinguished men associated in the authorship. In the Epilogue it is written:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Join then your voices, be the play excused</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For once, though no one living is abused;</span><br />

    <p>
      but as a matter of fact one purpose of the play was, as Dr. Johnson said, "to bring into contempt Dr. Woodward, the fossilist, a man not really or justly contemptible." Woodward was the author
      of a "History of Fossils," and his name survives in the Woodwardian Professorship of <span class="newpage"><a name='Page42'>[pg 42]</a></span>Geology at Cambridge. He was introduced as Dr.
      Cornelius in "Martin Scriblerus":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who nature's treasures would explore,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Her mysteries and arcana know.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Must high as lofty Newton soar,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Must stoop as delving Woodward low.</span><br />

    <p>
      The bridegroom in the play is called Fossile, and there was no mistaking the intention. Dr. Woodward had many friends, and these made known their disgust in the most unmistakable manner when
      "Three Hours After Marriage" was produced on January 16th, 1717, at Drury Lane Theatre. It ran for seven nights. "It had the fate which such outrages deserved," Dr. Johnson has written; "the
      scene in which Woodward was directly and apparently ridiculed by the introduction of a mummy and a crocodile, disgusted the audience, and the performance was driven off the stage with general
      condemnation."<a name='FNanchor_9_57'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_57'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The farce was not only dull, it was vulgar. And the geologist (played by Johnson) was not the only person
      introduced for the purpose of ridicule. Dennis was brought in as Sir Tremendous, and it was believed that Phoebe Clinket (played by Mrs. Bicknell) was intended for Anne Finch, Countess of
      Winchelsea, who, says Mr. Austin Dobson, "was alleged to have spoken contemptuously of Gay." Of this farce, Mr. Dobson writes: "It is perhaps fairer to say that he bore the blame, than that he
      is justly charged with its errors of taste"; and it is very probable that, while Gay generously accepted responsibility, Pope and Arbuthnot were equally culpable. "Too late I see, and confess
      myself mistaken in relation to the comedy; yet I do not think had I followed your advice and only introduced the mummy, that the absence of the crocodile had saved it," Gay wrote to Pope. "I
      cannot help laughing myself (though the vulgar do not consider it was designed to look ridiculous) to think how the poor monster and mummy were dashed at their reception; and when the <span
      class="newpage"><a name='Page43'>[pg 43]</a></span>cry was loudest I thought that if the thing had been written by another I should have deemed the town in some measure mistaken; and, as to your
      apprehension that this may do us future injury, do not think it; the Doctor [Arbuthnot] has a more valuable name than can be hurt by anything of this nature, and yours is doubly safe. I will,
      if any shame there be, take it all to myself, as indeed I ought, the notion being first mine, and never heartily approved of by you.... I beg of you not to suffer this, or anything else, to
      hurt your health. As I have publicly said that I was assisted by two friends, I shall still continue in the same story, professing obstinate silence about Dr. Arbuthnot and yourself."<a name=

    </p>
    <p>
      The publication in book form of "Three Hours After Marriage" by Lintott, who paid &pound;16 2s. 6d. for the copyright, a few days after the production, did nothing to arrest the torrent of
      abuse. "Gay's play, among the rest, has cost much time and long suffering to stem a tide of malice and party, that certain authors have raised against it," Pope wrote to Parnell. Amongst those
      foremost among the attackers was Addison, who perhaps had not forgotten or forgiven the parody of some of the lines in his play "Cato," which was introduced by Gay in "The What D'ye Call It."
      Gay, the most easy-going of men, was always stirred by criticism, and in this case he, with unusual energy, sat down to reply to his detractors. "Mr. Addison and his friends had exclaimed so
      much against Gay's 'Three Hours After Marriage' for obscenities, that it provoked him to write 'A Letter from a Lady in the City to a Lady in the Country' on that subject," so runs a passage in
      Spence's Anecdotes of Pope. "In it he quoted the passages which had been most exclaimed against, and opposed other passages to them from Addison's and Steele's plays. These were aggravated in
      the same manner that they served his, and appeared worse. Had it been published it would have made Addison appear ridiculous, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page44'>[pg 44]</a></span>which he
      could bear as little as any man. I therefore prevailed upon Gay not to print it, and have the manuscript now by me."<a name='FNanchor_11_59'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_59'><sup>[11]</sup></a> In
      Spence's Anecdotes there is another passage bearing on the same matter: "A fortnight before Addison's death, <a name='FNanchor_12_60'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_60'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Lord
      Warwick <a name='FNanchor_13_61'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_61'><sup>[13]</sup></a> came to Gay and pressed him in a very particular manner 'to go and see Mr. Addison,' which he had not done for
      a great while. Gay went, and found Addison in a very weak way. He received him in the kindest manner and told him, 'that he had desired this visit to beg his pardon, that he had injured him
      greatly, but that if he lived he should find that he would make it up to him.' Gay, on his going to Hanover, had great reason to hope for some good preferment; but all his views came to
      nothing. It is not impossible but that Mr. Addison might prevent them, from his thinking Gay too well with some of the great men of the former Ministry. He did not at all explain himself, in
      which he had injured him, and Gay could not guess at anything else in which he could have injured him so considerably."<a name='FNanchor_14_62'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_62'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
      It seems, however, more probable that Addison really had in mind the part he had taken in connection with "Three Hours After Marriage." Two critical publications, "A Complete Key to 'Three
      Hours After Marriage,'" and "A Letter to John Gay, Concerning his late Farce, entitled a Comedy," annoyed Gay; while Pope, too, and, in a minor degree, Arbuthnot, were attacked for their share
      in the farce. John Durand Breval, writing over the signature of Joseph Gay, published in 1717 "The Confederates: A Farce," in which he introduced a humorous caricature print of Pope, Gay and
      Arbuthnot, so that, says Professor Courthope, "Pope, at the height of his fame, found himself credited, though he seems to have had little to do with it, with the past paternity of a condemned
      play."<a name='FNanchor_15_63'></a><a href='#Footnote_15_63'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Another incident, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page45'>[pg 45]</a></span>recorded by Professor Courthope, further
      angered Pope: "While he was still sore at the mishap, Colley Cibber, playing in 'The Rehearsal,' happened to make an impromptu allusion to the unlucky farce, saying that he had intended to
      introduce the two kings of Brentford, 'one of them in the shape of a mummy, and t'other in that of a crocodile.' The audience laughed, but Pope, who was in the house, appeared (according to
      Cibber's account) behind the scenes and abused the actor in unmeasured terms for his impertinence. Cibber's only reply was to assure the enraged poet that, so long as the play was acted, he
      should never fail to repeat the same words. He kept his promise, thus committing the first of that series of offences which, in the poet's vindictive memory, marked him down for elevation to
      the throne of Dulness which was rendered vacant by the deposition of King Tibbald."<a name='FNanchor_16_64'></a><a href='#Footnote_16_64'><sup>[16]</sup></a> There is a rumour that Gay, in
      revenge for Cibber's banter of "Three Hours After Marriage," personally chastised the actor-dramatist,<a name='FNanchor_17_65'></a><a href='#Footnote_17_65'><sup>[17]</sup></a> but there is
      nothing definitely known about this. Anyhow, Gay was so irritated by the failure of this play that he did not produce anything at a theatre during the next seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Gay managed to exist through the three years after the production of "Three Hours After Marriage" is one of the stumbling blocks for the biographer. Of literary achievement during this
      period his life was barren. It is true that when he was abroad or in the country he was a guest, but even with this his expenses must have amounted to something. As he earned nothing by his
      pen, unless his friends provided him with money as well as giving him hospitality, it looks as if some relative must have died and left him a small sum. "As for Gay," Pope wrote to Caryll, June
      7th, 1717, "he is just on the wing for Aix-la-Chapelle, with Mr. Pulteney, the late Secretary (at War)."<a name='FNanchor_18_66'></a><a href='#Footnote_18_66'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Pulteney who
      had resigned office when there was a split in the Ministry, had in December, 1714, married a very beautiful <span class="newpage"><a name='Page46'>[pg 46]</a></span>woman, Anne Maria Gumley,
      daughter of a wealthy glass manufacturer. With them Gay went abroad for some months, and perhaps the solution of the problem above stated, is that while he went nominally as their guest, he was
      actually paid a salary as companion or secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident from Gay's "Epistle to the Right Honourable William Pulteney, Esq." (published in 1717) that the party stayed some while at Paris, for therein is an account of that city, an
      account in which the author betrays a sad insularity; and he was certainly at Aix in November. "I should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from Aix. You told me that writing was not
      good with the waters, and I find since, you are of my opinion, that it is as bad without the waters. But, I fancy, it is not writing, but thinking, that is so bad with the waters; and then you
      might write without any manner of prejudice if you write like our brother poets of these days." Pope wrote to him on November 8th: "... That Duchess [of Hamilton],<a name=
      'FNanchor_19_67'></a><a href='#Footnote_19_67'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Lord Warwick, Lord Stanhope, Mrs. Bellenden, Mrs. Lepell, and I cannot tell who else, had your letters ... I would send my
      services to Mr. Pulteney, but that he is out at Court, and make some compliment to Mrs. Pulteney, if she was not a Whig."<a name='FNanchor_20_68'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_20_68'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this letter it is evident that Gay was becoming well known in fashionable circles, and it is also clear that he had friends in the Court circle. "Gay is well at Court, and more than ever
      in the way of being served than ever.... Gay dines daily with the Maids of Honour," Pope had written to Martha Blount in December, 1716; and Gay, who would rather have had a place in the
      Household with nothing to do and no responsibility than anything else in the world, was not the man to refrain from endeavouring to improve the occasion. Mrs. Howard he had first met at
      Hanover, and in London contrived to turn the acquaintanceship into friendship. Knowing Gay's <span class="newpage"><a name='Page47'>[pg 47]</a></span>character and his ambition, it is probably
      doing him no injustice to say that he was first drawn to the lady by the belief that she might further his aims. However, it is only fair to say that he soon came to like her for herself, and
      long after he was convinced that she could be of no service to him he remained a very loyal and intimate friend. He was taken entirely into her confidence, as will presently be seen, and she
      even called him in to assist her when she was conducting an elaborate and stilted epistolatory flirtation with Lord Peterborough. It was most probably she who introduced him to Mrs. Bellenden,
      Mrs. Lepell, and the other ladies of the Court. Of Mrs. Howard and Gay, Dr. Johnson wrote: "Diligent court was paid to Mrs. Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk, who was much beloved by the
      King and Queen, to engage her interest for his promotion; but solicitations, verses, and flatteries were thrown away; the lady heard them and did nothing." This, however, is manifestly unfair,
      for it is now known that Mrs. Howard's influence was negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the ladies of the Court and others of Pope's friends, Gay paid tribute in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;

    <p>
      Gay was now on intimate terms with Lord Harcourt, whom he presently introduced into "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;

    <p>
      and early in 1718 he visited him, first at Cockthorpe and then at Stanton Harcourt, at which latter seat Pope was staying, working on the fifth volume of the "Iliad." In the following year Gay
      again crossed the Channel, possibly for the second time with the Pulteneys, but the only record of this trip is to be found in the following letter:&mdash;

      1720 "Poems on Several Occasions"&mdash;Gay Invests His Earnings in the South<br />

    <p>
      Gay in 1720 was in his thirty-fifth year, and he had commenced author some twelve years before this date. During this period his output had been very small, and his success not conspicuous. As
      a dramatist he had been a complete failure&mdash;his first play, "The Wife of Bath," was still-born, and the others, "The What D'ye Call It" and "Three Hours After Marriage," had practically
      been hooted off the stage, and had brought him in their train a considerable degree of unpopularity. Of his poems, the only ones of any marked merit were "The Shepherd's Week," and "Trivia,"
      and even these were unambitious, though not without merit. Gay now bethought him of collecting his poems, published and unpublished, and they were issued in two quarto volumes early in 1720,
      with the joint imprint of Jacob Tonson and his old publisher, Bernard Lintott, and with a frontispiece by William Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Poems on Several Occasions," as the collection was styled, were issued by subscription. His friends supported him admirably. Lord Burlington and Lord Chandos each put down his name for
      fifty copies, Lord Bathurst for ten copies; in all Gay made more than <span class="newpage"><a name='Page51'>[pg 51]</a></span>&pound;1,000 by the publication. To this success he alluded in his
      "Epistle to the Right Honourable Paul Methuen, Esq."<a name='FNanchor_1_70'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_70'><sup>[1]</sup></a>

    <p>
      What to do with the thousand pounds&mdash;a sum certainly far larger than any of which he had ever been possessed&mdash;Gay had not the slightest idea. He had just enough wisdom to consult his
      friends. Erasmus Lewis, a prudent man of affairs, advised him to invest it in the Funds and live upon the interest; Arbuthnot advised him to put his faith in Providence and live upon the
      capital; Swift and Pope, who understood him best, advised him to purchase <span class="newpage"><a name='Page52'>[pg 52]</a></span>an annuity. Bewildered by these divergent counsels, he did none
      of these things. Just when he was confronted with the necessity of making up his mind, Pope's friend, James Craggs the younger, of whom he wrote in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Bold, generous Craggs, whose heart was ne'er disguised,</span><br />

    <p>
      made him a present of some stock of the South Sea Company, at the same time, no doubt, telling him that in all probability it would rise in value. Here was a chance, dear to the heart of this
      hunter after sinecures, of getting something for nothing&mdash;or next to nothing. With his thousand pounds he purchased more South Sea stock. At what price Gay bought it is impossible to say,
      but it is not unlikely that Craggs' present was made in April, 1720, when the first money-subscription was issued at the price of &pound;300 for each &pound;100 stock. The poet's good fortune
      was at this moment in the ascendant. A mania for speculation burst over the town, and everybody bought and sold South Sea stock. In July it was quoted at &pound;1,000. If Gay had then sold out
      he would have realised a sum in the neighbourhood of &pound;20,000. His friends implored him to content himself with this handsome profit, but in vain. As Dr. Johnson put it, "he dreamed of
      dignity and splendour, and could not bear to obstruct his own fortune."<a name='FNanchor_2_71'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_71'><sup>[2]</sup></a> He who a few months ago had been practically
      penniless, could not now bring himself to be satisfied with an income of about a thousand a year. Realising that it was impossible entirely to overcome his obduracy, his friends then begged him
      at least to sell so much as would produce even a hundred a year in the Funds, "which," Fenton said to him, "will make you sure of a clean shirt and a shoulder of mutton every day." Gay was not
      to be moved from his resolve to become a great capitalist. Arguments were of no avail. The wilful man finally had his way. Almost from the moment he refused to yield to his friends' entreaties
      the price of South Sea stock declined rapidly. <span class="newpage"><a name='Page53'>[pg 53]</a></span>The "Bubble" burst, and in October South Sea stock was unsaleable at any price. Gay lost not
      only his profit but his capital, and was again reduced to penury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay spoke his mind about the "Bubble" in "A Panegyrical Epistle to Mr. Thomas Snow, Goldsmith, near Temple Bar: Occasioned by his Buying and Selling of the Third Subscriptions, taken in by the
      Directors of the South Sea Company, at a thousand per cent," which was published by Lintott in 1721:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O thou, whose penetrative wisdom found</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The South-Sea rocks and shelves, where thousands drown'd,</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Among the fools who gaped for golden showers?</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>No wonder if we found some poets there,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who live on fancy, and can feed on air;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>No wonder they were caught by South-Sea schemes</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who ne'er enjoy'd a guinea but in dreams;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>No wonder they their third subscription sold,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For millions of imaginary gold:</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>No wonder that their fancies wild can frame&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Strange reasons, that a thing is still the same,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But you (whose judgment scorns poetic flights)</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With contracts furnish boys for paper kites.</span><br />

    <p>
      One of the immediate results of the disaster was Gay's inability to fulfil his obligations to one of the publishers of his "Poems on Several Occasions":&mdash;

    <p>
      The loss of his fortune was, of course, a very severe blow to Gay, but as ever, his friends gathered round him. Instead of being angry with him for his folly&mdash;but no one of his friends was
      ever angry with him&mdash;they looked upon him, and treated him, just as a spoilt child who had disobediently tried to get over a hedge and had scratched himself in the endeavour. They put
      their heads together to find "something" for him. Gay, of course, was not easy to deal with; it was difficult to make him listen to reason. He could not be brought to believe that it was not
      his due to receive something for nothing. He had been secretary to Lord Clarendon's brief Mission to Hanover; why had not diplomacy something to offer him? The Princess of Wales had asked for a
      copy of a set of his verses; was there no place for him at Court? He had praised members of the Royal Family in verse; was there somewhere&mdash;somehow&mdash;a sinecure in the Household for
      him? It seems that Gay really could not understand the position. Could not Mrs. Howard do something in his interest? Could not the friends of Pope do aught to secure that little post? Or Lord
      Burlington, or Lord Bathurst, or William Pulteney, or some one of the rest? <span class="newpage"><a name='Page55'>[pg 55]</a></span>He became petulant, and it is a tribute to his charm that not
      one of these persons was ever disgusted with him, but continued to feed him, keep him, and pet him, and made their friends and their friends' friends do likewise. In fact, this delightful,
      whimsical, helpless creature leant upon all who were stronger, and each one upon whom he leant loved him to his dying day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay's health, which was never robust, gave way under his bitter disappointment, and in 1721 he went in the early autumn to Bath, where Mrs. Bradshaw wrote to Mrs. Howard, September 19th: "He is
      always with the Duchess of Queensberry." In the following year he was again ill, and went again to recuperate at the Somersetshire watering place.

        "After every post-day, for these eight or nine years, I have been troubled with an uneasiness of spirit, and at last I have resolved to get rid of it and write to you. I do not deserve you

    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name='Page56'>[pg 56]</a></span>This was certainly ungrateful of Gay, but allowance may perhaps be made for him on the ground that he was, as Coxe has written, "of a
      sanguine disposition, was easily raised and as easily depressed. He mistook the usual civilities of persons of distinction for offers of assistance, and argued from the common promises of a
      Court certain preferment." He accordingly always suffered from mortification, about which he was prone to discourse. This was a foible well known to his friends, and even Pope could not refrain
      from gently chaffing him: "I wish you joy of the birth of the young Prince,<a name='FNanchor_5_74'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_74'><sup>[5]</sup></a> because he is the only prince we have from

      Gay's friends, who had persistently been on the look-out to help him, at last met with some small measure of success. "I am obliged to you for your advice, as I have been formerly for your
      assistance in introducing me into business," Gay wrote to Swift from London, February 3rd, 1723. "I shall this year be Commissioner of the State Lottery, which will be worth to me a hundred and
      fifty pounds. And I am not without hopes that I have friends that will think of some better and more certain provision for me."<a name='FNanchor_8_77'></a><a href=

      Commissionship and the residence to some small extent soothed Gay's ruffled vanity, and were beyond question convenient.

        "As for the reigning amusements of the town, it is entirely music; real fiddles, bass-viols and hautboys; not poetical harps, lyres and reeds. There's nobody allowed to say, I sing, but an
        eunuch or an Italian woman. Everybody is grown now as great a judge of music, as they were in your time of poetry, and folks that could not distinguish one tune from another now daily dispute
        about the different styles of Handel, Bononcine, and Attilio. People have now forgot Homer and Virgil and C&aelig;sar, or at least they have lost their ranks. For in London and Westminster,

        he sincerely wishes me well. Pope has just now embarked himself in another great undertaking as an author, for of late he has talked only as a gardener. He has engaged to translate the

        have seen you before you went to Tunbridge. I dare say you are now with your friends, but not with one who more sincerely wishes to see you easy and happy than I do; if my power was equal to

        "We have a young lady, Mary Jennings, here that is very particular in her desires. I have known some ladies who, if ever they prayed and were sure their prayers would prevail, would ask an
        equipage, a title, a husband or <span class="newpage"><a name='Page60'>[pg 60]</a></span>matadores; but this lady, who is but seventeen and has but thirty thousand pounds, places all her wishes
        in a pot of good ale. When her friends, for the sake of her shape and complexion, would dissuade her from it, she answers, with the truest sincerity, that by the loss of shape and complexion
        she can only lose a husband, but that ale is her passion. I have not as yet drank with her, though I must own I cannot help being fond of a lady who has so little disguise of her practice,
        either in her words or appearance. If to show you love her you must drink with her she has chosen an ill place for followers, for she is forbid with the waters. Her shape is not very unlike a
        barrel, and I would describe her eyes, if I could look over the agreeable swellings of her cheeks, in which the rose predominates; nor can I perceive the least of the lily in her whole
        countenance. You see what &pound;30,000 can do, for without that I could never have discovered all these agreeable particularities. In short, she is the <i>ortolan</i>, or rather <i>
        wheat-ear</i>, of the place, for she is entirely a lump of fat; and the form of the universe itself is scarce more beautiful, for her figure is almost circular. After I have said all this, I
        believe it will be in vain for me to declare I am not in love, and I am afraid that I have showed some imprudence in talking upon this subject, since you have declared that you like a friend
        that has a heart in his disposal. I assure you I am not mercenary and that &pound;30,000 have not half so much power with me as the woman I love."

        "I have long wished to be able to put in practice that valuable worldly qualification of being insincere. One of my chief reasons is that I hate to be particular, and I think if a man cannot
        conform to the customs of the world, he is not fit to be encouraged or to live in it. I know that, if one would be agreeable to men of dignity one must study to imitate them, and I know which
        way they get money and places. I cannot indeed wonder that the talents requisite for a great statesman are so scarce in the world, since so many of those who possess them are every month cut
        off in the prime of their life at the Old Bailey.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Another observation I have made upon courtiers is that if you have any friendship with any particular one, you must be entirely governed by his friendship and <span class="newpage"><a name=
        'Page62'>[pg 62]</a></span>resentments, not your own; you are not only to flatter him but those that he flatters, and, if he chances to take a fancy to any man whom you know that he knows to
        have the talents of a statesman, you are immediately to think both of them men of the most exact honour. In short, you must think nothing dishonest or dishonourable that is required of you,
        because, if you know the world, you must know that no statesman has or ever will require anything of you that is dishonest or dishonourable.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then you must suppose that all statesmen, and your friend in particular (for statesmen's friends have always seemed to think so) have been, are, and always will be guided by strict justice,
        and are quite void of partiality and resentment. You are to believe that he never did or can propose any wrong thing, for whoever has it in his power to dissent from a statesman, in any one
        particular, is not capable of his friendship. This last word, friendship, I have been forced to make use of several times, though I know that I speak improperly, for it has never been allowed
        a Court term. This is some part of a Court creed, though it is impossible to fix all the articles, for as men of dignity believe one thing one day and another the next, so you must daily
        change your faith and opinion; therefore the mood to please these wonderful and mighty men is never to declare in the morning what you believe until your friend has declared what he
        believes&mdash;for one mistake this way is utter destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I hope these few reflections will convince you that I know something of the art of pleasing great men. I have strictly examined most favourites that I have known, and think I judge right,
        that almost all of them have practised most of these rules on their way to preferment. I cannot wonder that great men require all this from their creatures, since most of them have practised
        it themselves, or else they had never arrived to their dignities.

        "After you have told me that you hate writing letters, it would be very ungrateful not to thank you for so many as you have written for me. Acting contrary to one's inclinations, for the
        service of those one likes, is a strong proof of friendship; yet, as it is painful, it ought never to be exacted but in case of great necessity. As such I look upon that correspondence in

        "I am very much pleased to find you are of my opinion. I have always thought that the man who will be nothing but a man of wit oftener disobliges than entertains the company. There is nothing
        tries our patience more than that person who arrogantly is ever showing his superiority over the company he is engaged in. He and his fate I think very like the woman whose whole ambition is
        only to be handsome. <i>She</i> is in continual care about her own charms and neglects the world; and <i>he</i> is always endeavouring to be more witty than all the world, which makes them
        both disagreeable companions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The warmth with which I attack wit will, I am afraid, be thought to proceed from the same motive which makes the old and ugly attack the young and handsome; but if you examine well all those
        of the character I have mentioned you will find they are generally but pretenders to either wit or beauty, and in justification of myself I can say, and that with great sincerity, I respect
        wit with judgment, and beauty with humility, whenever I meet it.

        "If I agree with you, that wit is very seldom to be found in sincerity, it is because I think neither wit nor sincerity is often found; but daily experience shows us it is want of wit, and

    </h3>
    <p>
      During 1723 Gay wrote a tragedy, "The Captives," which at the end of the year he read to the royal circle at Leicester House. "When the hour came," Johnson has recorded, "he saw the Princess
      [of Wales] and her ladies all in expectation, and, advancing with reverence, too great for any other attention, stumbled at a stool, and, falling forward, threw down a weighty Japanese screen.
      The Princess started, the ladies screamed, and poor Gay, after all the disturbance, was still to read his play."<a name='FNanchor_1_81'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_81'><sup>[1]</sup></a> "The
      Captives" was produced at Drury Lane Theatre in January, 1724, and according to the <i>Biographica Dramatica</i> was "acted nine nights with great applause," the third, or author's night, being
      by the command of the Prince and Princess of Wales. According, however, to Fenton, "Gay's play had no success. I am told he gave thirty guineas to have it acted on the fifth night."<a name=

        have been the catastrophe of the fall, the rewarding virtue and the relieving the distressed. For that could not fail to give some pleasure in fiction, which, it is plain, gives you the

      There is no mention of Gay during the first nine months of the year 1724, after which it has been possible to gather scant information. Apparently, encouraged by the kindly interest displayed
      by the Princess of Wales, Gay, still obsessed with his desire for a place, went frequently to Court. "I hear nothing of our friend Gay, but I find the Court keep him at hard meat. I advised him
      to come over here with a Lord-Lieutenant,"<a name='FNanchor_3_83'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_83'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Swift wrote to Pope, September 29th, 1725. To this Pope replied on October
      15th: "Our friend Gay is used as the friends of Tories are by Whigs, and generally by Tories too. Because he had humour he was supposed to have dealt with Dr. Swift; in like manner as when
      anyone had learning formerly, he was thought to have dealt with the devil. He puts his whole trust at Court in that lady whom I described to you."<a name='FNanchor_4_84'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_4_84'><sup>[4]</sup></a> "That lady," presumably was Mrs. Howard. But Gay, unable to secure the interest of the politicians, and getting weary of waiting on his friends, suddenly
      bethought himself of making a direct appeal to royalty. "Gay is writing tales for Prince William,"<a name='FNanchor_5_85'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_85'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Pope wrote to Swift on
      December 10th. "Mr. Philips<a name='FNanchor_6_86'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_86'><sup>[6]</sup></a> will take this <span class="newpage"><a name='Page68'>[pg 68]</a></span>very ill for two reasons,
      one that he thinks all childish things belong to him, and the other because he will take it ill to be taught that one may write things to a child without being childish." Than which last few
      prettier compliments have been paid to Gay.

      Though they had long been in correspondence, Swift and Gay had not yet met. Swift, of course, had often in his mind a visit to London&mdash;he admitted the temptation, but resisted it. "I was
      three years reconciling myself to the scene, and the business to which fortune had condemned me, and stupidity was what I had recourse to,"<a name='FNanchor_7_87'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_7_87'><sup>[7]</sup></a> he had written to Gay from Dublin, January 8th, 1723. "Besides, what a figure should I make in London, while my friends are in poverty, exile, distress, or
      imprisonment, and my enemies with rods of iron?" At last, however, in March, 1726, he did come to London, and he was the guest of Gay, whom he subsequently referred to as "my landlord at
      Whitehall." He saw much of Gay. "I have lived these two months past for the most part in the country, either at Twickenham with Mr. Pope, or rambling with him and Mr. Gay for a fortnight
      together. Yesterday Lord Bolingbroke and Mr. Congreve made up five at dinner at Twickenham,"<a name='FNanchor_8_88'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_88'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Swift wrote to Tickell from
      London on July 7th. Like the rest, Swift came to love Gay dearly, and Gay was no whit less attracted to the great man, who promised on his next visit to stay again in Whitehall. "My landlord,"
      he wrote in a letter addressed jointly to Pope and Gay, October 15th, 1726, "who treats me with kindness and domesticity, and says that he is laying in a double stock of wine."<a name=
      'FNanchor_9_89'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_89'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Swift had been introduced to Mrs. Howard&mdash;it may be by Gay&mdash;and she too wished to entertain him. "I hope you will get
      your house and wine ready, to which Mr. Gay and I are to have access when you are at Court; for, as to Mr. Pope, he is not <span class="newpage"><a name='Page69'>[pg 69]</a></span>worth
      considering on such occasions,"<a name='FNanchor_10_90'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_90'><sup>[10]</sup></a> he wrote to her from Dublin, February 1st, 1727.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay had become more and more on good terms with the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, especially with the Duchess, who treated him as a sort of pet lap-dog. "Since I wrote last," Gay told Swift
      in a letter dated September 16th, 1726, "I have been always upon the ramble. I have been in Oxfordshire with the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, and at Petersham, and wheresoever they would
      carry me; but as they will go to Wiltshire<a name='FNanchor_11_91'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_91'><sup>[11]</sup></a> without me on Tuesday next, for two or three months, I believe I shall then
      have finished my travels for this year, and shall not go further from London than now and then to Twickenham."<a name='FNanchor_12_92'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_92'><sup>[12]</sup></a> It was
      as well that Gay remained in London, else probably his "Fables" would never have appeared. Gay, who had begun to compose the "Fables" in 1725, was, according to the habit of the man, not to be
      hurried. "I have of late been very much out of order with a slight fever, which I am not yet quite free from," he wrote to Swift in October, 1726. "If the engravers keep their word with me I
      shall be able to publish my poems soon after Christmas." But of course the engravers did not keep their word. Swift, a more energetic person, became almost fractious at the repeated delays in
      the publication, and wrote to Pope on November 17th: "How comes Gay to be so tedious? Another man can publish fifty thousand lies sooner than he can publish fifty fables."<a name=
      'FNanchor_13_93'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_93'><sup>[13]</sup></a> And still there were delays. "My Fables are printed," he told Swift on February 18th, 1727; "but I cannot get my plates
      finished, which hinders the publication. I expect nothing and am likely to get nothing."<a name='FNanchor_14_94'></a><a href='#Footnote_14_94'><sup>[14]</sup></a> At last, in the spring, the
      volume appeared, with the imprint of J. Tonson and J. Watts, and with this dedication: "To His Highness <span class="newpage"><a name='Page70'>[pg 70]</a></span>William Duke of Cumberland these
      new Fables, invented for his amusement, are humbly dedicated by His Highness's most faithful and most obedient servant, John Gay."
    </p>
    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      Gay, of course, expected some reward for this courtier-like attention to the son of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the poet and his friends again believed that his future was assured
      when they heard that Her Royal Highness had said, or at least was reported to have said, that she should "take up the hare"&mdash;an allusion to the "Fable" of "The Hare and Many
      Friends":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A Hare who in a civil way,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Complied with ev'ry thing, like Gay,</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who haunt the wood, or graze the plain.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Her care was never to offend.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And ev'ry creature was her friend.</span><br />

    <p>
      On June 12th, 1727, George I. died, and Gay felt sure that at last the hour had struck when the "place" so long and diligently sought, would be bestowed on him. The new Queen did not, indeed,
      forget him; she did what in his eyes was far worse, she offered him the sinecure post of Gentleman Usher to the Princess Louisa,<a name='FNanchor_15_95'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_15_95'><sup>[15]</sup></a> then two years old, with a salary of &pound;200 a year. Gay's disappointment was bitter, and for a person usually so placid, his indignation tremendous.
      What ground for hope he had had, he, as Dr. Johnson has said, "had doubtless magnified with all the wild expectation and vanity,"<a name='FNanchor_16_96'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_16_96'><sup>[16]</sup></a> "The Queen's family is at last settled," Gay wrote bitterly to Swift on October 22nd, "and in the list I was appointed Gentleman Usher to the Princess
      Louisa, the youngest Princess, which, upon account that I am so far advanced in life, I had declined accepting, and have endeavoured, in the best manner I could, to make my excuses by a letter
      to her Majesty. So now all my expectations are vanished and I have no <span class="newpage"><a name='Page71'>[pg 71]</a></span>prospect, but in depending wholly upon myself and my own conduct. As
      I am used to disappointments I can bear them, but as I can have no more hopes I can no more be disappointed, so that I am in a blessed condition."<a name='FNanchor_17_97'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_17_97'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Pope, than whom no man loved Gay better, could not bring himself to sympathise with his irate brother poet.

        "I have many years ago magnified, in my own mind, and repeated to you, a ninth beatitude, added to the eight in the Scripture: "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be
        disappointed. I could find in my heart to congratulate you on this happy dismission from all Court dependance. I dare say I shall find you the better and the honester man for it many years
        hence; very probably the healthfuller, and the cheerfuller into the bargain. You are happily rid of many cursed ceremonies, as well as of many ill and vicious habits, of which few or no men
        escape the infection, who are hackneyed and trammelled in the ways of a Court. Princes, indeed, and Peers (the lackies of Princes) and Ladies (the fools of Peers) will smile on you the less;
        but men of worth and real friends will look on you the better. There is a thing, the only thing which kings and queens cannot give you, for they have it not to give&mdash;liberty, which is
        worth all they have, and which as yet Englishmen need not ask from their hands. You will enjoy that, and your own integrity, and the satisfactory consciousness of having not merited such
        graces from Courts as are bestowed only on the mean, servile, flattering, interested and undeserving. The only steps to the favour of the great are such complacencies, such compliances, such
        distant decorums, as delude them in their vanities, or engage them in their passions. He is their greatest favourite who is the falsest; and when a man, by such vile graduations arrives at
        the height of <span class="newpage"><a name='Page72'>[pg 72]</a></span>grandeur and power, he is then at best but in a circumstance to be hated, and in a condition to be hanged for serving their
        ends. So many a Minister has found it."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I can only add a plain uncourtly speech," Pope wrote again to Gay ten days later. "While you are nobody's servant you may be anybody's friend, and, as such, I embrace you in all conditions
        of life. While I have a shilling you shall have sixpence, nay, eightpence, if I can contrive to live upon a groat." But if Pope took the matter calmly, Swift, on the other hand, completely
        lost his temper and wrote as if voluntary attendance at Court made it obligatory upon the Queen to provide for the courtier.

      Swift could not forgive the Court for the offer, Mrs. Howard for not exerting her influence to get a better post for her prot&eacute;g&eacute;. "I desire my humble service to Lord Oxford, Lord
      Bathurst, and particularly to Miss Blount, but to no lady at Court. God bless you for being <span class="newpage"><a name='Page73'>[pg 73]</a></span>a greater dupe than I. I love that character
      too myself, but I want your charity," he wrote to Pope, August 11th, 1729; but Pope replying on October 9th said: "The Court lady<a name='FNanchor_19_99'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_19_99'><sup>[19]</sup></a> I have a good opinion of. Yet I have treated her more negligently than you would do, because you will like to see the inside of a Court, which I do not ...

      More than once Swift took up his pen to avenge his friend for the slight that he considered had been passed upon him. In "A Libel on the Rev. Mr. Delany and His Excellency Lord Cartaret," he
      wrote in 1729:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
      Two years later he returned to the attack in "An Epistle to Mr. Gay ":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>How could you, Gay, disgrace the Muse's train,</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or with her go-cart amble side by side!</span><br />

    <p>
      It is a little difficult at this time of day to understand Swift's indignation. Gay was already in the enjoyment <span class="newpage"><a name='Page74'>[pg 74]</a></span>of a sinecure of
      &pound;150 a year; he was offered another of &pound;200 a year&mdash;for the post of Gentleman-Usher involved no duties save occasional attendance at Court, and to this the poet had shown
      himself by no means averse. A total gift of &pound;350 a year for nothing really seems rather alluring to a man of letters, and it is difficult to understand why Gay refused the offer, unless
      it was, as the editors of the standard edition of Pope's Correspondence suggest: "The affluent friends who recommended Gay to reject the provisions were strangers to want, and with unconscious
      selfishness they thought less of his necessities than of venturing their spleen against the Court."
    </p>
    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      Swift, unable effectively to vent his anger on Caroline, chose to regard Mrs. Howard as the cause of the mortification of his friend. Mrs. Howard, however, not only had nothing to do with the
      offer of the place of Gentleman-Usher to Gay, the patronage being directly in the Queen's hands, but, as has been indicated, was unable to secure for him, or anyone else, a place at Court of
      any description. Certainly she was in blissful ignorance of having given offence, for as Gay wrote to the Dean so late as February 15th, 1728: "Mrs. Howard frequently asks after you and desires
      her compliments to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the matters affected not a whit the relations between Mrs. Howard and Gay; against her he had no ill-feeling, and their correspondence continued on the same lines of intimacy as before.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1727<br />
       "THE BEGGAR'S OPERA"
    </h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      The opera to which allusion is made in Mrs. Howard's letter of October, 1727, was "The Beggar's Opera," upon which Gay had been actively engaged for some time past, and which was then nearing
      completion. "You remember," Gay wrote to Swift, October 22nd, 1727, "you were advising me to go into Newgate to finish my scenes the more correctly. I now think I shall, for I have no
      attendance to hinder me; but my opera is already finished."<a name='FNanchor_1_103'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_103'><sup>[1]</sup></a> To which Swift replied from Dublin on November 27th: "I am
      very glad your opera is finished, and hope your friends will join the readers to make it succeed, because you are ill-used by others."<a name='FNanchor_2_104'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_2_104'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was natural that Swift should be especially interested in "The Beggar's Opera," because the first suggestion of it had come from Swift in a letter to Pope, written as far back as August
      30th, 1716<a name='FNanchor_3_105'></a><a href='#Footnote_3_105'><sup>[3]</sup></a> "Dr. Swift had been observing once to Mr. Gay, what an odd pretty sort of thing a Newgate Pastoral might
      make," Pope once remarked. "Gay was inclined to try at such a thing for some time, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page79'>[pg 79]</a></span>but afterwards thought it would be better to write a
      comedy on the same plan. This was what gave rise to 'The Beggar's Opera.' He began on it, and when first he mentioned it to Swift, the Doctor did not much like the project. As he carried it on,
      he showed what he wrote to both of us; and we now and then gave a correction, or a word or two of advice; but it was wholly of his own writing. When it was done neither of us thought it would
      succeed. We showed it to Congreve, who, after reading it over, said: 'It would either take greatly or be damned confoundedly."<a name='FNanchor_4_106'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_4_106'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dilatory as Gay always was, he contrived to finish his opera by about the end of the year. "John Gay's opera is just on the point of delivery," Pope wrote to Swift in January, 1728. "It may be
      called, considering its subject, a jail-delivery. Mr. Congreve, with whom I have commemorated you, is anxious as to its success, and so am I. Whether it succeeds or not, it will make a great
      noise, but whether of claps or hisses I know not. At worst, it is in its own nature a thing which he can lose no reputation by, as he lays none upon it."<a name='FNanchor_5_107'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_5_107'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Not only Swift, Pope, and Congreve were doubtful as to the opera's chance of success. Colley Cibber refused it for Drury Lane Theatre, and even when it was
      accepted by John Rich for his theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Quin had such a poor opinion of it, that he refused the part of Captain Macheath. Very sound was the judgment of Rich,
      immortalised by Pope in "The Dunciad" (Book III, lines 261-264):&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Immortal Rich! how calm he sits at ease,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>'Midst snows of paper, and fierie tale of pease;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And proud his Mistress's orders to perform,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm;</span><br />

    <p>
      and the opera, to repeat a well-known <i>mot</i> of the day, "made Gay rich and Rich gay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page80'>[pg 80]</a></span>The Beggar's Opera" was produced on January 29th, 1728, with the following cast:&mdash;

    <p>
      At the first performance the fate of the opera hung for some time in the balance. Quin is recorded as having said that there was a disposition to damn it, and that it was saved by the song, "O
      ponder well! be not severe!" the audience being much affected by the innocent looks of Polly, when she came to those two lines which exhibit at once a painful and ridiculous image&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>O ponder well! be not severe!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For on the Rope that hangs my Dear</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Depends poor Polly's Life.<a name='FNanchor_6_108'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_108'><sup>[6]</sup></a></span><br />

    <p>
      Pope, too, and the rest of Gay's friends were present. "We were all at the first night of it, in great uncertainty of the event; till we were very much encouraged by hearing the Duke of Argyll,
      who sat in the next box to us, say: "It will do&mdash;it must do!&mdash;I see it in the eyes of them," he said. "This was a good while before the first act was over, and so gave us ease soon;
      for the Duke (besides his own good taste) has a more particular knack than any one now living, in discovering the taste of the public. He was quite right in this, as usual, the good nature of
      the audience appeared stronger and stronger every set, and ended in a clamour of applause."<a name='FNanchor_7_109'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_109'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the opera was due to many causes. Some liked it for its barely veiled allusions on politicians. "Robin <span class="newpage"><a name='Page81'>[pg 81]</a></span>of Bagshot, <i>
      alias</i> Gorgon, <i>alias</i> Bluff Bob, <i>alias</i> Carbuncle, <i>alias</i> Bob Booty," was very obviously intended for Walpole and his "dear charmers" for his wife and Molly Skerrett. It
      may well be believed that the song, "How happy could I be with either" brought down the house; and the highwayman must have evoked a hearty laugh with&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And the statesman, because he's so great,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Thinks his trade as honest as mine.</span><br />

    <p>
      Certainly the songs had much to do in the matter of pleasing the audience. As a literary work, "The Beggar's Opera" has no great claims, but there is a spontaneous humour about it that has
      charm. But it was the <i>milieu</i> that, acting on the hint thrown out years before by Swift, Gay chose that appealed to the public taste. Highwaymen and women of the town are not romantic
      figures, but Gay made the highwaymen handsome and lively, and the women of the town beautiful and attractive, and over them all he cast a glamour of romance and sentimentalism. Even Newgate
      seemed a pleasing place, for in this fantasy the author was careful to omit anything of the horrors of a prison in the early eighteenth century. Gay, in fact, did for the stage with "The
      Beggar's Opera" what, a century later Bulwer Lytton and Harrison Ainsworth did for the reading public with "Ernest Maltravers," "Jack Sheppard," and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morality of the opera was much discussed. Swift took the field, and wrote in its favour in the <i>Intelligencer</i> (No. 3):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, indeed, that Mr. Gay, the author of this piece, has been somewhat singular in the course of his fortune, for it has happened that after fourteen years attending the Court, with a
      large stock of real merit, a modest and agreeable conversation, a hundred promises, and five hundred friends, he has failed of preferment, and upon a very weighty reason. He lay under the
      suspicion of having written a libel, or lampoon, against a great minister. It <span class="newpage"><a name='Page82'>[pg 82]</a></span>is true, that great minister was demonstratively convinced,
      and publicly owned his conviction, that Mr. Gay was not the author; but having lain under the suspicion, it seemed very just that he should suffer the punishment; because in this most reformed
      age, the virtues of a prime minister are no more to be suspected than the chastity of C&aelig;sar's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be allowed, that 'The Beggar's Opera' is not the first of Mr. Gay's works, wherein he has been faulty with regard to courtiers and statesmen. For, to omit his other pieces, even in his
      'Fables,' published within two years past, and dedicated to the Duke of Cumberland, for which he was promised a reward, he has been thought somewhat too bold upon the courtiers. And although it
      be highly probable he meant only the courtiers of former times, yet he acted unwarily, by not considering that the malignity of some people might misinterpret what he said to the disadvantage
      of present persons and affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have now done with Mr. Gay as a politician and shall consider him henceforth only as the author of 'The Beggar's Opera,' wherein he has, by a turn of humour entirely new, placed vices of
      all kinds in the strongest and most odious light, and thereby done eminent service, both to religion and morality. This appears from the unparalleled success he has met with. All ranks,
      parties, and denominations of men, either crowding to see his opera, or reading it with delight in their closets; even Ministers of State, whom he is thought to have most offended (next to
      those whom the actors represented) appear frequently at the theatre, from a consciousness of their own innocence, and to convince the world how unjust a parallel, malice, envy, and disaffection
      to the Government have made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am assured that several worthy clergymen in this city went privately to see 'The Beggar's Opera' represented; and that the fleering coxcombs in the pit amused themselves with making
      discoveries, and spreading the names of those gentlemen round the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page83'>[pg 83]</a></span>I shall not pretend to vindicate a clergyman who would appear openly in his habit at the theatre, with such a vicious crew as might
      probably stand round him, at such comedies and profane tragedies as are often represented. Besides, I know very well, that persons of their function are bound to avoid the appearance of evil,
      or of giving cause of offence. But when the Lords Chancellors, who are Keepers of the King's Conscience; when the Judges of the land, whose title is reverend; when ladies, who are bound by the
      rules of their sex to the strictest decency, appear in the theatre without censure; I cannot understand why a young clergyman, who comes concealed out of curiosity to see an innocent and moral
      play, should be so highly condemned; nor do I much approve the rigour of a great prelate, who said, 'he hoped none of his clergy were there.' I am glad to hear there are no weightier objections
      against that reverend body, planted in this city, and I wish there never may. But I should be very sorry that any of them should be so weak as to imitate a Court chaplain in England, who
      preached against 'The Beggar's Opera,' which will probably do more good than a thousand sermons of so stupid, so injudicious, and so prostitute a divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this happy performance of Mr. Gay, all the characters are just, and none of them carried beyond nature, or hardly beyond practice. It discovers the whole system of that commonwealth, or
      that <i>imperium in imperio</i> of iniquity established among us, by which neither our lives nor our properties are secure, either in the highways, or in public assemblies, or even in our own
      houses. It shows the miserable lives, and the constant fate, of those abandoned wretches: for how little they sell their lives and souls; betrayed by their whores, their comrades, and the
      receivers and purchasers of those thefts and robberies. This comedy contains likewise a satire, which, without enquiring whether it affects the present age, may possibly be useful in times to
      come; I mean, where the author <span class="newpage"><a name='Page84'>[pg 84]</a></span>takes the occasion of comparing the common robbers of the public, and their various stratagems of betraying,
      undermining and hanging each other, to the several arts of the politicians in times of corruption....
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon the whole, I deliver my judgment, that nothing but servile attachment to a party, affectation of singularity, lamentable dulness, mistaken zeal, or studied hypocrisy, can have the least
      reasonable objection against this excellent moral performance of the celebrated Mr. Gay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, if "The Beggar's Opera" is taken as irony, there is really nothing at all to be said against it; but the majority of any audience do not understand irony, and to many the whole thing
      seemed vicious, an approval of vice, and even an incitement to wrong-doing. Dr. Herring, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, preached against the Opera in, it is said, Lincoln's Inn Chapel,
      and censured it as giving encouragement not only to vice but to crimes, by making a highwayman the hero and dismissing him at last unpunished. In the Preface to Dr. Herring's "Sermons," it is
      added that "several street-robbers confessed in Newgate that they raised their courage at the playhouse by the songs of Macheath."<a name='FNanchor_8_110'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_8_110'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Others certainly shared the views of the clergyman. When on September 15th, 1773, at the Old Bailey, fifteen prisoners were sentenced to death, forty to
      transportation, and eight to a whipping, it is recorded that the magistrate, Sir John Fielding, "informed the Bench of Justices that he had last year written to Mr. Garrick concerning the
      impropriety of performing 'The Beggar's Opera,' which never was represented without creating an additional number of real thieves,"<a name='FNanchor_9_111'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_9_111'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and that to this effect he not only wrote to Garrick at Drury Lane Theatre, but also to Colman at Covent Garden Theatre. "Mr. Colman's compliments to Sir
      John Fielding," the latter replied, "he does not think his the only house in Bow Street where thieves are hardened and encouraged, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page85'>[pg 85]</a></span>and will
      persist in offering the representation of that admirable satire, 'The Beggar's Opera.'"<a name='FNanchor_10_112'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_112'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Sir John Hawkins, Chairman of
      the Middlesex Bench of Justices, also held the view that the Opera was harmful, and in 1776, wrote: "Rapine and violence have been gradually increasing since its first representation."<a name=
      'FNanchor_11_113'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_113'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Dr. Johnson took a saner view, and one that was subsequently supported by Sir Walter Scott, and is generally accepted
      to-day. "Both these decisions are surely exaggerated," he wrote in reference to the opinions expressed by Swift and Dr. Herring. "The play, like many others, was plainly written only to divert,
      without any moral purpose, and is therefore likely to do good; nor can it be conceived, without more speculation than life requires or admits, to be productive of much wit. Highwaymen and
      housebreakers seldom frequent the playhouse or mingle in any elegant diversion; nor is it possible for anyone to imagine that he may rob as safely because he sees Macheath reprieved upon the
      stage."<a name='FNanchor_12_114'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_114'><sup>[12]</sup></a> And again, he said: "I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being present at its
      representation. At the same time I do not deny that it may have some influence by making the character of a rogue familiar and in some degree pleasing."<a name='FNanchor_13_115'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_13_115'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the piece was immense, and its vogue tremendous. "The famous 'Beggar's Opera' appeared upon the stage early in the ensuing season; and was received with greater applause than was
      ever known: besides being acted in London sixty-three nights without interruption, and renewed the next season with equal applause, it spread into all the great towns of England; was played in

      Gay was in these days the happiest man in the world. His play was successful, he was making money, and he had had his little dig at Walpole. "John Gay ... is at present so employed in the
      elevated airs of his Opera ... that I can scarce obtain a categorical answer ... to anything," Pope wrote to Swift in February, "but the Opera succeeds extremely, to yours and my extreme
      satisfaction, of which he promises this post to give you a full account."<a name='FNanchor_17_119'></a><a href='#Footnote_17_119'><sup>[17]</sup></a>

      continue the whole season," Pope wrote to Swift, March 23rd, 1728. "So he has more than a fence about his thousand pounds; he will soon be thinking of a fence about his two thousand. Shall no

      Colley Cibber, in his "Apology" said that "Gay had more skilfully gratified the public taste than all the brightest authors that ever wrote before him," and although this was undoubtedly a
      piece of friendly exaggeration, it is a fact that John Gay was now a personage. "Mr. Gay's fame continues; but his riches are in a fair way of diminishing; he is gone to the Bath," Martha
      Blount wrote to Swift, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page91'>[pg 91]</a></span>May 7th;<a name='FNanchor_23_125'></a><a href='#Footnote_23_125'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and two months later, with

      secured further notoriety when, in the summer, Lavinia Fenton, who had played the heroine in the Opera, ran away with a Duke. "The Duke of Bolton, I hear," he wrote to Swift from Bath, "has run

      The success of "The Beggar's Opera" heartened Gay, as a first great success heartens any man. At once he conceived the idea of following up this triumph with another opera, but, before actually
      getting to work, he took things easily. In March he stayed at Cashiobury with Pulteney, visiting from there Lord Bathurst and the Bolingbrokes. Shortly after he went to Bath, where he found
      many friends, including Henrietta, Duchess of Marlborough.

      two-and-twenty, by this thoughtlessness and cullibility. He has as little foresight of age, sickness, poverty, or loss of admirers, as a girl of fifteen."<a name='FNanchor_3_131'></a><a href=

    <p>
      Gay was naturally greatly elated by the success of "The Beggar's Opera." This recompensed him for the neglect, or, as undoubtedly he regarded it, the ingratitude of the Court, and, what pleased
      him as much, it filled his purse, which he always liked to fill, apparently for the joy of emptying it as soon as possible. Also, it greatly enhanced his reputation: from a writer of minor
      importance, he now took his place as a personage. After a long apprenticeship, he had at length "arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, he promptly composed a sequel to "The Beggar's Opera," which he called by the name of the heroine of that piece, that is to say, "Polly." The best summary of "Polly" has been
      given by Mr. Paull, in his interesting paper on Gay<a name='FNanchor_6_134'></a><a href='#Footnote_6_134'><sup>[6]</sup></a>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Macheath has been transported across the herring-pond ... <span class="newpage"><a name='Page96'>[pg 96]</a></span>He succeeds in escaping from the plantations, and has become the leader of a
      band of pirates, under an assumed name, and disguised as a black man. Jenny Driver is now his mistress (presumably he has forgotten her treachery in 'The Beggar's Opera'). Polly sails across
      the ocean to find him, but is entrapped by Mrs. Trapes, a procuress, who sells her to Ducat, a rich merchant. Mrs. Ducat, who is jealous, helps Polly to escape; she assumes a boy's dress and
      continues her search for Macheath. She is captured by the pirates, and she and Macheath meet, neither recognising the other. The pirates are attacking the English settlement; the Indians are
      helping the settlers. At first the pirates are successful, and the young Indian Prince is captured, but ultimately they are defeated, Polly herself capturing Macheath, who is condemned to death
      by the Indian Prince. Then she learns from Jenny Driver who the pirate chief is, and his life is promised her as her reward; but his execution has already taken place, and she has to console
      herself with the hand of the Indian Prince, who has fallen in love with her. Even this skeleton will show that the novelty and unity of design which counted for so much in 'The Beggar's Opera'
      are changed for intricacy of plot. There is no cohesion in the story: there is no reason why the catastrophe should be brought about in one way rather than another; what interest there is turns
      on an improbable story rather than on the development of character. Evidently Gay reckoned largely on the opportunities he had afforded himself for satire on the Court, and for contrasting the
      noble and untutored savage with the man tainted by the vices of civilisation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Polly" was accepted for production by Rich at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields: the subsequent proceedings are but told by the author himself in his Preface, dated March 25th, 1729, to the
      printed version of the book of the opera:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "After Mr. Rich and I were agreed upon terms and <span class="newpage"><a name='Page97'>[pg 97]</a></span>conditions for bringing this piece on the stage, and that everything was ready for a
      rehearsal, the Lord Chamberlain sent an order from the country to prohibit Mr. Rich to suffer any play to be rehearsed upon his stage till it has been first of all supervised by his Grace. As
      soon as Mr. Rich came from his Grace's secretary (who had sent for him to receive the before-mentioned order) he came to my lodgings and acquainted me with the orders he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon the Lord Chamberlain's coming to town I was confined by sickness, but in four or five days I went abroad on purpose to wait upon his Grace, with a faithful and genuine copy of this piece,
      excepting the <i>errata</i> of the transcriber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I have heard several suggestions and false insinuations concerning the copy, I take this occasion in the most solemn manner to affirm, that the very copy I delivered to Mr. Rich was written
      in my own hand, some months before at the Bath, from my own first foul blotted papers; from this, that for the playhouse was transcribed, from whence Mr. Steele, the prompter, copied that which
      I delivered to the Lord Chamberlain; and, excepting my own foul blotted papers, I do protest I know of no other copy whatsoever, than those I have mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The copy which I gave into the hands of Mr. Rich had been seen before by several persons of the greatest distinction and veracity, who will do me the honour and justice to attest it; so that
      not only by them, but by Mr. Rich and Mr. Steele, I can (against all insinuation or positive affirmation) prove in the most clear and undeniable manner, if occasion required, what I have here
      upon my own honour and credit asserted. The Introduction, indeed, was not shown to the Lord Chamberlain, which, as I had not then settled, was never transcribed in the playhouse copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was on Saturday morning, December 7th, 1728, that I waited upon the Lord Chamberlain. I desired to have the honour of reading the Opera to his Grace, but he <span class="newpage"><a name=
      'Page98'>[pg 98]</a></span>ordered me to leave it with him, which I did upon expectation of having it returned on the Monday following; but I had it not till Thursday, December 12th, when I
      received it from his Grace with this answer, '<i>that it was not allowed to be acted, but commanded to be suppressed</i>.' This was told me in general, without any reason assigned, or any
      charge against me, of my having given any particular offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since this prohibition, I have been told, that I am accused, in general terms, of having written many disaffected libels and seditious pamphlets. As it hath ever been my utmost ambition (if
      that word may be used on this ocasion) to lead a quiet and inoffensive life, I thought my innocence in this particular would never have required a justification; and as this kind of writing is
      what I have ever detested, and never practised, I am persuaded so groundless a calumny can never be believed but by those who do not know me. But as general aspersions of this sort have been
      cast upon me, I think myself called upon to declare my principles; and I do, with the strictest truth, affirm that I am as loyal a subject, and as firmly attached to the present happy
      establishment, as any of those who have the greatest places or pensions. I have been informed too, that, in the following play, I have been charged with writing immoralities; that it is filled
      with slander, and calumny against particular great persons, and that Majesty itself is endeavoured to be brought into ridicule and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I knew every one of these charges was in every point absolutely false and without the least grounds, at first I was not at all affected by them; but when I found they were still insisted
      upon, and that particular passages, which were not in the play, were quoted, and propagated to support what had been suggested, I could no longer bear to lie under those false accusations; so,
      by printing it, I have submitted and given up all present views of profit which might accrue from the stage; which undoubtedly will be some satisfaction to the worthy gentlemen <span class=
      "newpage"><a name='Page99'>[pg 99]</a></span>who have treated me with so much candour and humanity, and represented me in such favourable colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But as I am conscious to myself, that my only intention was to lash, in general, the reigning of fashionable vices, and to recommend and set virtue in as amiable light as I could; to justify
      and vindicate my own character, I thought myself obliged to print the Opera without delay, in the manner I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the play was principally designed for representation, I hope, when it is read, it will be considered in that light; and when all that hath been said against it shall appear to be entirely
      misunderstood or misrepresented; if, some time hence, it should be permitted to appear on the stage, I think it necessary to acquaint the public that, as far as a contract of this kind can be
      binding, I am engaged to Mr. Rich to have it represented upon his theatre."
    </p>
    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that there was adequate ground for the Lord Chamberlain's <i>veto</i>. In "The Beggar's Opera" Gay had beyond all question lampooned Walpole, and in "Polly" he returned to
      the attack, there being no doubt that in the opening scene, Ducat, the West Indian planter, was intended for the Minister. The production might well have led to disturbances if both political
      parties had been represented at the first performance. Walpole was the least vindictive of men, as witness his generous attitude towards Sunderland and the other ministers involved in the
      scandal of the South Sea "Bubble," but he may well have thought that Gay was going too far. Gay himself was harmless, but, as Walpole knew, the author, either consciously or unconsciously, was
      acting for the Opposition party; and Walpole, when he thought it worth while, had a short and effective way with his political enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prohibition being largely an affair of party, or at least being so regarded, a battle royal ensued. "Polly" could not be performed in public, but, there being no censorship of books, it
      could be printed. Gay's friends, therefore, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page100'>[pg 100]</a></span>decided that the Opera should be published by subscription. To a man and a woman the
      Opposition rallied round the author. The Duchess of Queensberry "touted" for him everywhere, even at Court. The King at a Drawing-room asked what she was doing. "What must be agreeable, I am
      sure," she replied, "to anyone so humane as your Majesty, for it is an act of charity, and a charity to which I do not despair of bringing your Majesty to contribute." This, of course, was a
      gratuitous piece of impertinence&mdash;for the Lord Chamberlain acts as the official mouthpiece of the Sovereign&mdash;and it could not be overlooked. Another story is: The Duchess was so
      vehement in her attempt to have the embargo removed from Gay's play, that she offered to read it to His Majesty in his closet, that he might be satisfied there was no offence in it. George II
      escaped from this dilemma by saying, he should be delighted to receive her Grace in his closet, but he hoped to amuse her better than by the literary employment she proposed.<a name=
      'FNanchor_7_135'></a><a href='#Footnote_7_135'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the true story, the day after the Duchess's interview with the King (February 27th, 1729), William Stanhope, the Vice-Chamberlain, carried to the Duchess a verbal message not to come
      to Court; whereupon she sat down and wrote a letter for him to take to his Majesty. "The Duchess of Queensberry," so ran her reply, "is surprised and well pleased that the King hath given her
      so agreeable a command as to stay from Court, where she never came for diversion, but to bestow a great civility on the King and Queen; she hopes by such an unprecedented order as this is, that
      the King will see as few as he wishes at his Court, particularly such as are to think or speak truth. I dare not do otherwise, and ought not, nor could have imagined that it would not have been
      the very highest compliment that I could possibly pay the King to endeavour to support truth and innocence in his house, particularly when the King and Queen both told me that they had not read
      Mr. Gay's play. I have certainly <span class="newpage"><a name='Page101'>[pg 101]</a></span>done right, then, to stand by my own words rather than his Grace of Grafton's, who hath neither made use
      of truth, judgment, nor honour, through this whole affair, either for himself or his friends."<a name='FNanchor_8_136'></a><a href='#Footnote_8_136'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Stanhope read this, and
      begged the Duchess to reflect before sending it. She consented to write another letter, did so, and handed it to him. He chose the first. The Duke of Queensberry supported his wife, and
      although the King pressed him to remain, resigned his office of Admiral of Scotland&mdash;though Gay wrote to Swift,<a name='FNanchor_9_137'></a><a href='#Footnote_9_137'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
      "this he would have done, if the Duchess had not met with this treatment, upon account of ill-usage from the Ministers," and that this incident "hastened him in what he had determined." The
      affair created an immense sensation in Court circles. "The Duchess of Queensberry is still the talk of the town. She is going to Scotland," Mrs. Pendarves wrote to Mrs. Anne Granville, March
      14th, 1729.... "My Lady Hervey told her the other day that 'now she was banished, the Court had lost its chief ornament,' the Duchess replied, 'I am entirely of your mind.' It is thought my
      Lady Hervey spoke to her with a sneer, if so, her Grace's answer was a very good one."<a name='FNanchor_10_138'></a><a href='#Footnote_10_138'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the immediate results of the campaign was that the apartments that had been granted to Gay in Whitehall, which belonged to the Crown, had, by order, to be surrendered. On the other hand,
      two large editions, amounting to 10,500 copies, of "Polly, An Opera: being the Second Part of 'The Beggar's Opera.' Written by Mr. Gay. With the Songs and Basses engraved on Copper-plates,"
      were printed in 1729, and from the sale Gay derived between &pound;1,100 and &pound;1,200.<a name='FNanchor_11_139'></a><a href='#Footnote_11_139'><sup>[11]</sup></a> In 1777 Colman produced
      "Polly" in a revised version, but it failed to attract.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an end of Gay's hopes of Court preferment, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page102'>[pg 102]</a></span>that was clear to every one. It was not unexpected. "I wish John Gay success in his
      pursuit," Bolingbroke had written to Swift in June, 1727, "but I think he has some qualities which will keep him down in the world."<a name='FNanchor_12_140'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_12_140'><sup>[12]</sup></a> When the worst was known, Arbuthnot wrote to Swift on the following November 30th: "There is certainly a fatality upon poor Gay. As for hope of preferment
      [at St. James's], he has laid it aside. He has made a pretty good bargain (that is, a Smithfield one) for a little place in the Custom-house, which was to bring him in about a hundred a year.
      It was done as a favour to an old man, and not at all to Gay. When everything was concluded, the man repented, and said he would not part with his place. I have begged Gay not to buy an annuity
      upon my life; I am sure I should not live a week."<a name='FNanchor_13_141'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_141'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <hr class="medium" />
    <p>
      It may be that Gay thought that he might in time live down the disfavour at Court in which he had been involved by the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry and his other partisans. He may even have
      had a momentary hope, in 1730, when the office of Poet-Laureate was vacant that the position might be offered to him, who had written "Fables" for a young Prince. When Colley Cibber was
      appointed, Gay probably had it brought home to him that his day as a courtier had passed for good and all. Certainly he is credited, though on what authority is not known, with a share in the
      burlesque, "Ode for the New Year [1731]. Written by Colley Cibber, Esq.," in which his disappointment is vented in somewhat coarse expression. This begins,

     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That honest statesman Bob.</span><br />

    <p>
      That Gay was furious there is no question, and he attacked Walpole in one of the second series of his "Fables" (which appeared posthumously in 1738), entitled "The Vulture, the Sparrow, and
      Other Birds," which concluded:

    <p>
      The animus is evident, and it is clear that Gay's sense of humour had entirely deserted him. A man who had been a hanger-on at Court for more than ten years, and bidding diligently all the time
      for a sinecure, could but arouse laughter when, discarded at length by those in power, he says proudly, "I court no favour, ask no place."

      With the composition of "Polly," the literary life of Gay came practically to an end, although he survived until December 4th, 1732. During these four years he worked not at all, save
      occasionally on the second series of "Fables."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the prohibition of "Polly," Gay, who had been ill during 1728, had a severe attack of fever, during which he was attended by the faithful Arbuthnot, and carefully tended by the Duchess of
      Queensberry.

        "No words can tell you the great concern I feel for you; I assure you it was not, and is not, lessened by the immediate apprehension I have now every day lain under of losing my mother. Be
        assured, no duty less than that should have kept me one day from attending your condition. I would come and take a room by you at Hampstead, to be with you daily, were she not still in danger
        of death. I have constantly had particular accounts of you from the doctor [Arbuthnot], which have not ceased to alarm me yet. God preserve your life, and restore your health! I really beg it
        for my own sake, for I feel I love you more than I thought in health, though I always loved you a great deal. If I am so unfortunate as to bury my poor mother, and yet have the good fortune
        to have my prayers heard for you, I hope we may live most of our remaining days together. <span class="newpage"><a name='Page106'>[pg 106]</a></span>If, as I believe, the air of a better clime,
        as the southern part of France, may be thought useful for your recovery, thither I would go with you infallibly; and it is very probable we might get the Dean [Swift] with us, who is in that
        abandoned state already in which I shall shortly be, as to other cares and duties. Dear Gay, be as cheerful as your sufferings will permit: God is a better friend than a Court: even any
        honest man is a better. I promise you my entire friendship in all events."

      Gay gradually got well. "I am glad to hear of your recovery, and the oftener I hear it, the better, when it becomes easy to you to give it," Pope, who remained a regular correspondent, wrote to
      him in January, 1729. But, though Gay was better in health, his spirits were low.

        "My melancholy increases, and every hour threatens me with some return of my distemper, nay, I think I may rather say I have it on me. Not the divine looks, the kind favours, and the
        expressions of the divine Duchess, who, hereafter, shall be in the place of a queen to me&mdash;nay, she shall be my queen&mdash;nor the inexpressible goodness of the Duke, can in the least

        Pope, what a barren soil (to me so) have I been striving to produce something out of. Why did I not take your advice before my writing Fables for the Duke, not to write them! It is my very
        hard fate I must get nothing, write for them or against them. I find myself in such a strange confusion and depression of spirits that I have not strength enough even to make my will, though
        I perceive by many warnings I have no continuing city here. I begin to look upon myself as one already dead, and desire, my dear Mr. Pope, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page107'>

      <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Life is a jest, and all things show it,</span><br />

      <p>
        with what more you may think proper. If anyone should ask how I could communicate this after death, let it be known, it is not meant so, but my present sentiment in life. What the bearer
        brings besides this letter, should I die without a will, which I am the likelier to do, as the law will settle my small estate much as I should do so myself, let it remain with you, as it has
        long done with me, the remembrance of a dead friend; but there is none like you, living or dead."

      Both Swift and Pope remained faithful to Gay, and in their correspondence there are many allusions to him. "Mr. Gay," wrote Swift to Pope, "is a scandal to all lusty young fellows with healthy
      countenances; and, I think, he is not intemperate in a physical sense. I am told he has an asthma, which is a disease I commiserate more than deafness, because it will not leave a man quiet

        "I am but just recovered from the severest fit of sickness that ever anybody had who escaped death. I was several times given up by the physicians, and everybody that attended me; and upon my
        recovery was judged to be in so ill a condition, that I should be miserable for the remainder of my life; but contrary to all expectation, I am perfectly recovered, and have no remainder of
        the distempers that attacked me, which were at the same time, fever, asthma, and pleurisy.

      <p>
        "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page108'>[pg 108]</a></span>I am now in the Duke of Queensberry's house, and have been so ever since I left Hampstead; where I was carried at a time that it was
        thought I could not live a day. Since my coming to town, I have been very little abroad, the weather has been so severe.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I must acquaint you (because I know it will please you) that during my sickness I had many of the kindest proofs of friendship, particularly from the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, who, if
        I had been their nearest relation and nearest friend, could not have treated me with more constant attendance then; and they continue the same to me now.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You must undoubtedly have heard, that the Duchess took up my defence with the King and Queen, in the cause of my play, and that she has been forbid the Court for interesting herself to
        increase my fortune, by the publication of it without being acted. The Duke, too, has given up his employment (which he would have done if the Duchess had not met with this treatment) upon
        account of ill-usage from the Ministers; but this hardened him in what he had determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The play ['Polly '] is now almost printed, with the music, words, and basses, engraved on thirty-one copper-plates, which, by my friends' assistance, has a possibility to turn greatly to my
        advantage. The Duchess of Marlborough has given me a hundred pounds for one copy; and others have contributed very handsomely; but as my account is not yet settled, I cannot tell you
        particulars.
      </p>
      <p>
        "For writing in the cause of virtue, and against the fashionable vices, I am looked upon at present as the most obnoxious person, almost, in England. Mr. Pulteney tells me I have got the
        start of him. Mr. Pope tells me that I am dead, and that this obnoxiousness is the reward for my inoffensiveness in my former life.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wish I had a book ready to send you; but I believe I shall not be able to complete the work till the latter end of next week....
      </p>

        "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page109'>[pg 109]</a></span>I am impatient to finish my work, for I want the country air; not that I am ill, but to recover my strength; and I cannot leave my

        "While I am writing this, I am in the room next to our dining-room, with sheets all around it, and two people from the binder folding sheets. I print the book at my own expense, in quarto,
        which is to be sold for six shillings, with the music.

        "You see I do not want industry; and I hope you will allow that I have not the worst economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mrs. Howard has declared herself strongly, both to the King and Queen, as my advocate. The Duchess of Queensberry is allowed to have shown more spirit, more honour, and more goodness, than
        was thought possible in our times; I should have added, too, more understanding and good sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You see my fortune (as I hope my virtue will) increases by oppression. I go to no Courts, I drink no wine; and am calumniated even by Ministers of State; and yet am in good spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Most of the courtiers, though otherwise my friends, refused to contribute to my undertaking. But the City, and the people of England, take my part very warmly; and, I am told, the best of
        the citizens will give me proofs of it by their contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I cannot omit telling you, that Dr. Arbuthnot's attendance and care of me showed him the best of friends. Dr. Hollins, though entirely a stranger to me, was joined with him, and used me in
        the kindest and most handsome manner."<a name='FNanchor_2_144'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_144'><sup>[2]</sup></a>

    <p>
      In consequence of this hubbub about "Polly," Gay became a notorious character, as Arbuthnot in a letter to Swift (March 19th, 1729) remarks very humorously. "John Gay, I may say with vanity,
      owes his life, under God, to the unwearied endeavours and care of your humble <span class="newpage"><a name='Page110'>[pg 110]</a></span>servant; for a physician who had not been passionately his
      friend could not have saved him," he wrote. "I had, besides my personal concern for him, other motives of my care. He is now become a public person, a little Sacheverell; and I took the same
      pleasure in saving him, as Radcliffe did in preserving my Lord Chief Justice Holt's wife, whom he attended out of spite to her husband, who wished her dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The inoffensive John Gay is now become one of the obstructions to the peace of Europe, the terror of Ministers, the chief author of the <i>Craftsmen</i>, and all the seditious pamphlets which
      have been published against the Government. He has got several turned out of their places; the greatest ornament of the Court [the Duchess of Queensberry] banished from it for his sake; another
      great lady [Mrs. Howard] in danger of being <i>chas&eacute;e</i> likewise; about seven or eight Duchesses pushing forward, like the ancient circumcelliones in the Church, who shall suffer
      martyrdom upon his account at first. He is the darling of the City. If he should travel about the country he would have hecatombs of roasted oxen sacrificed to him. Since he became so
      conspicuous, Will Pulteney hangs his head to see himself so much outdone in the career of glory. I hope he will get a good deal of money by printing his play ['Polly']; but I really believe he
      would get more money by showing his person; and I can assure you, this is the very identical John Gay whom you formerly knew, and lodged in Whitehall, two years ago."<a name=

      Gay was now the avowed <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, so he spent the greater part of his closing years either at their country seat, Middleton Stoney,
      Amesbury, in Wiltshire, or at their London house in Burlington Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay, who really asked nothing better than to be a pet of the great in this world, was happy enough. In May, 1729, he went to Scotland with the Duke of Queensberry, <span class="newpage"><a
      name='Page111'>[pg 111]</a></span>and his only trouble was that the success of "Polly" made it attractive to unscrupulous booksellers. "He has about twenty lawsuits with booksellers for pirating
      his book,"<a name='FNanchor_4_146'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_146'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Arbuthnot wrote to Swift on May 8th. In the following month, the same correspondent, reports, "Mr. Gay is

        "I am going very soon into Wiltshire with the Duke of Queensberry. Since I had that severe fit of sickness, I find my health requires it; for I cannot bear the town as I could formerly. I
        hope another summer's air and exercise will reinstate me. I continue to drink nothing but water, so that you cannot require any poetry from me. I have been very seldom abroad since I came to
        town, and not once at Court. This is no restraint upon me, for I am grown old enough to wish for retirement....
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have left off all great folks but our own family; perhaps you will think all great folks little enough to leave off us, in our present situation. I do not hate the world, but I laugh at
        it; for none but fools can be in earnest about a trifle."<a name='FNanchor_1_155'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_155'><sup>[1]</sup></a>

      Earlier in the year Gay had revised his earliest play "The Wife of Bath," which had been produced unsuccessfully at Drury Lane Theatre on May 12th, 1713, and the new version was staged on
      January 19 of this year <span class="newpage"><a name='Page116'>[pg 116]</a></span>at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. "My old vamped play has got me no money, for it had no success," the
      author wrote to Swift in the letter of March 3rd; to which Swift replied from Dublin sixteen days later: "I had never much hopes of your vamped play, although Mr. Pope seemed to have, and
      although it were ever so good; but you should have done like the parsons, and changed your text&mdash;I mean, the title, and the names of the persons. After all, it was an effect of idleness,
      for you are in the prime of life, when invention and judgment go together."

        "I expect, in about a fortnight, to set out for Wiltshire.... My ambition, at present, is levelled to the same point that you direct me to; for I am every day building villakins, and have
        given over that of castles. If I were to undertake it in my present circumstances, I should, on the most thrifty scheme, soon be straightened; and I hate to be in debt; for I cannot bear to
        pawn five pounds' worth of my liberty to a tailor or a butcher. I grant you this is not having the true spirit of modern nobility, but it is hard to cure the prejudice of education.

      From this letter it will be seen that Gay was endeavouring to make some return to his host and hostess for their kindness in looking after him by acting as a private secretary to the Duchess.
      But it may be taken for granted that his duties were merely nominal, and it may equally be taken for granted that his assistance was of little value, and only accepted nominally in order to
      lessen the weight <span class="newpage"><a name='Page117'>[pg 117]</a></span>of the obligation under which they thought&mdash;probably erroneously&mdash;he might be suffering. Why Gay should have
      led a life of dependence unless he liked it, it is not easy to see, for when he died about thirty months later, he left the then not inconsiderable sum of &pound;6,000. Gay, who never did
      to-day what could by any possibility be postponed, neglected, of course, to make a will. As he died intestate, his fortune was divided between his surviving sisters, Katherine Bailer and Joanna
      Fortescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gay until the end kept up his correspondence with Mrs. Howard, and his letters to her are often delightful reading, especially when he had nothing in particular to say, or when he was able to
      poke kindly fun at his hostess and protectress.

        "It is what the Duchess never would tell me&mdash;so that it is impossible for me to tell you&mdash;<i>how she does</i>: but I cannot take it ill, for I really believe it is what she never
        really and truly did to anybody in her life. As I am no physician and cannot do her any good, one would wonder how she could refuse to answer this question out of common civility; but she is
        a professed hater of common civility, and so I am determined never to ask her again. If you have a mind to know what she hath done since she came here, the most material things that I know of
        is, that she hath worked a rose, and milked a cow, and those two things I assure you are of more consequence, I verily believe, than hath been done by anybody else.

        "Mrs. Herbert was very angry with her Grace the night before she left the town, that she could part with her friends with such an indecent cheerfulness; she wishes she had seen you at the
        same time, that she might have known whether she could have carried this happy indifference through, or no. She is grown a great admirer of two <span class="newpage"><a name='Page118'>

        worthy imitation: at this very instant she herself is in their way. She had a mind to write to you, but cannot prevail with herself to set about it; she is now thinking of Mrs. Herbert, but
        is too indolent to tell me to make her compliments to her. Just this minute she is wishing you were in this very room; but she will not give herself the trouble to say so to me: all that I
        know of it is, she looks all this, for she knows I am writing to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        "There is, indeed, a very good reason for her present indolence, for she is looking upon a book which she seems to be reading; but I believe the same page hath lain open before her ever since
        I began this letter. Just this moment she hath uttered these words: 'that she will take it as a very great favour if you will speak to Mrs. Herbert to speak to Lord Herbert, that he would
        speak to anybody who may chance to go by Mr. Nix's house, to call upon him to hasten his sending the piece of furniture, which, perhaps as soon as she receives it, may tempt her to write to
        somebody or other that very little expects it';&mdash;for she loves to do things by surprise. She would take it kindly if you write to her against this thing comes here; for I verily believe
        she will try whether or no it be convenient for writing, and perhaps she may make the trial to you; she did not bid me say this, but as she talks of you often, I think you have a fair chance.

        "As soon as you are settled at Marble Hill, I beg you will take the widow's house for me, and persuade the Duchess to come to Petersham. But, wherever you are, at present I can only wish to
        be with you: do what you can for me, and let me hear from you till the Duchess <span class="newpage"><a name='Page119'>[pg 119]</a></span>writes to you. You may write to me, and if you express
        any resentment against her for not writing, I will let her know it in what manner you shall please to direct me."

        and says, that if she can bear herself, or think that anybody else can, she intends to make her visit next week. Now, it is my opinion that she need never have any scruples of this kind; but
        as to herself, you know she hath often an unaccountable way of thinking, and, say what you will to her, she will now and then hear you, but she will always think and act for herself. I have
        been waiting three or four minutes for what she hath to say, and at last she tells me she cannot speak one word more, and at the same time is so very unreasonable as to desire you would write

      </p>

        those who helped me on to where I wished to be sooner than I feared I could be. Pray tell Miss Meadows that I was in hopes she would have made a dutiful visit to her father. If anyone else

        "You cannot imagine in what due time your letter came; for I had given you up, and with great pains had very near brought our friend Mr. Gay to own that nobody cared for us, and a few more
        thoughts which shall now be nameless. I am sincerely sorry that you have been ill, and very very glad that you are better and think of life; for I know none whom one could more wish to have
        life than yourself. I do not in the least approve of your changing your way of thinking of me, for I was convinced it was a good one, and when such opinions change, it is seldom for the
        better; if it could on my account, I declare you would be in the wrong, for to my knowledge I improve in no one thing. The best thing I can say for myself is, that I feel no alteration in the
        regard and inclination I have to you. I have no comprehension of what I said in my letter; but at that time my body was distempered, and very likely my mind also.... I know nothing of coming
        to town; I only know that when I do I shall not be sorry to see you; and this is knowing a great deal; for I shall not be glad to come, and shall only come if it be unavoidable: this is the
        blunt truth. I own it would look less like indifference if I had written some civil lie."

        in the fashionable expression, I conclude <span class="newpage"><a name='Page125'>[pg 125]</a></span>you will impute it to her manner. She was really concerned very much, that, after she knew
        you were ill, we were so long before we could get a letter from you: let her contradict this if she can. You tell her you are riding for your life; I fancy she would do it for yours, though
        she will not for her own. I believe that she will not like that I should say anything more about her; so that I shall leave you to your own thoughts about what she hath said herself; for I
        find she doth not much care to be talked to, and as little likes to be talked of: if she writes truth, I hope she will allow me the liberty to do the same.... I have sometimes a great mind to
        answer the above letter, but I know she will do what she will; and as little as she likes herself, she likes her own advice better than anybody's else, and that is a reason, in my opinion,
        that should prevail with her to take more care of herself. I just before said I would say no more upon this subject; but if I do not lay down the pen, I find I cannot help it. I have no
        desire to come to town at all; for if I were there I cannot see you; so that unless she turns me away I am fixed for life at Amesbury: so that, as to everything that relates to me, I refer
        you to her letters."

      "To prevent all further quarrels and disputes, I shall let you know that I have kissed hands for the place of Mistress of the Robes. Her Majesty did me the honour to give me the choice of Lady
      of the Bedchamber, or that, which I find so much more agreeable to me, that I did not take one moment to consider of it. The Duchess of Dorset resigned it for me; and everything as yet promises
      more happiness for the latter part of my life than I have yet had a prospect of. Seven nights' quiet sleep, and seven easy days have almost worked a miracle upon me; for if I cannot say I am
      perfectly well, yet it is certain even my pain is more supportable than it was. I shall now often visit Marble Hill; my time is become very much my own, and I shall see it without the dread of
      being obliged to sell it to answer the engagement I had put myself under to avoid a greater evil. Mr. H[oward] took possession of body and goods, and was not prevailed upon till yesterday to
      resign the former for burial. Poor Lord Suffolk took so much care in the will he made, that the best lawyers say it must stand good. I am persuaded it will be tried to the uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have at this time a great deal of business upon my hands, but not from my Court employment. You must take as a particular favour. The Duchess of Queensberry shall hear from me soon: she has
      a most extraordinary way of making her peace; but she does tell truth, and I told a lie when I said I hated her; for nothing is more true than that I love her most sincerely. However, I put it
      into your hands to tell her what you think proper; and if she can but feel half for me that I should for her under the same circumstances, it will be punishment sufficient for what I have
      suffered from her neglect of me. I shall certainly see Highclere this summer, and shall expect some people to meet me there. I hope the chairs will be done, <span class="newpage"><a name=
      'Page129'>[pg 129]</a></span>for I do not know whether I ought to expect to be preferred before them. If you find her inclined to think me wrong in any particular, desire her to suspend her
      judgment till then; and if not to please me, to satisfy her own curiosity, she may come. I have taken care of what you desired me. I have done my best; I hope, for my sake, it will succeed
      well, for I shall be more concerned, I dare say, if it should not than you would be."

      "Your letter was not ill-bestowed, for I found in it such an air of satisfaction that I have a pleasure every time I think of it. I fancy (though by her silence she seems to approve of your
      Ladyship's conduct) the Duchess will meet you at Highclere; for those that have a real friendship cannot be satisfied with real relations; they want to inquire into the minutest circumstances
      of life, that they may be sure things are as happy as they appear to be, and that is a curiosity that is excusable.

      "I do not like lawsuits; I wish you could have your right without them, for I fancy there never was one since the world began, that, besides the cost, was not attended with anxiety and
      vexation. But as you descended from lawyers,<a name='FNanchor_5_165'></a><a href='#Footnote_5_165'><sup>[5]</sup></a> what might be my plague, perhaps may be only your amusement. Nobody but
      yourself hath let us know anything about you. Judge, then, how welcome your ladyship's letter was to me. I find this change of life of yours is a subject that I cannot so well write upon; it is
      a thing that one cannot so well judge of in general. But as for your Ladyship's conduct in this juncture, my approbation goes for nothing, for all the world knows that I am partial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have a mind to make me happy, write to me, for of late I have had but very little chance, and only <span class="newpage"><a name='Page130'>[pg 130]</a></span>chance, of seeing you. If
      ever you thought well of me, if ever you believed I wished you well, and wished to be of service to you, think the same of me, for I am the same, and shall always be so.

      "Your friend Mrs. Howard is now Countess of Suffolk. I am still so much a dupe, that I think you mistake her. Come to Amesbury, and you and I will dispute this matter, and the Duchess shall be
      judge. But I fancy you will object against her; for I will be so fair to you, as to own that I think she is of my side; but, in short, you shall choose any impartial referee you please. I have
      heard from her; Mr. Pope has seen her; I beg that you would suspend your judgment till we talk over this affair together; for, I fancy, by your letter, you have neither heard from her, nor seen
      her; so that you cannot at present be as good a judge as we are. I will be a dupe for you at any time; therefore I beg it of you, that you would let me be a dupe in quiet.

    <p>
      "I shall be very uneasy till I hear how this matter has ended. A letter from you was not necessary to make me remember you, but a letter was absolutely necessary to make me think you deserved
      one. The Duchess did not tell me why I did not see you at Highclere, but I do believe it was a good one; because she knows bringing of you there would have pleased us both. As I never knew what
      liberty was, I cannot tell you how much I was delighted with this summer's expeditions. I never see Mr. Pope nor Mrs. Blount, though I never go to Marble Hill without sending to them. She has
      been ill, but was well last time I sent; but you know she has a peculiar pleasure in refusing her friends.
    </p>

      "Let me hear often from you. I am glad you think of coming to Twickenham. I hope we shall meet at Marble Hill; but do not fail of letting me know as soon as possible whether the Duchess is
      convinced I was in no wise in fault, and that she does me the justice in believing I can never willingly be so to me. If you do not leave off <i>ladyship</i>, I shall complain to the Duchess,
      who shall make you go supperless to bed. Exercise agrees so well with me, that I cannot advise you not to use it; but if her Grace feeds you moderately, I should think your exercise ought to be

      became annoyed at the <i>ennui</i> which is so often the result of an unoccupied life. Anyhow, in his letters there crept in a note of irritability, which has not previously been sounded.

      In May was first performed at the Haymarket Theatre "Acis and Galatea," of which he wrote the "book" and Handel the music; but this was not work upon which he had been lately engaged&mdash;in
      fact, both words and music had been ready for ten years. Gay, however, did occasionally put in some time on literary work, and at his death left the "book" of an opera "Achilles," which was
      produced on February 10th, 1733, at the scene of his triumph with "The Beggar's Opera," the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields; "The Distrest Wife" and a farce, "<span class="newpage"><a name=
      'Page135'>[pg 135]</a></span>The Rehearsal at Goatham," which last were printed, respectively, in 1743 and 1754. He was at this time composing very leisurely a second series of "Fables," which
      were ready for the press at the time of his death, but did not appear until 1738.

        "Every man, and every boy, is writing verses on the royal hermitage: I hear the Queen is at a loss which to prefer; but for my own part I like none so well as Mr. Poyntz's<a name=

      The "royal hermitage" was a building erected by Queen Caroline in the grounds of Richmond Palace, and decorated with busts of her favourite philosophers. This letter of Pope seems
      extraordinary, and it is a little difficult to guess what inspired the suggestion contained in it. "This is but shabby advice," Croker has written, "considering the general tone of Pope's
      private correspondence, as well as his published satires, and seems peculiarly strange in the circumstances in which Gay himself and the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry, on his account, stood
      with the Queen. If it were not for the introduction of Lady Suffolk's name, I should have thought Pope's advice sheer irony, <span class="newpage"><a name='Page137'>[pg 137]</a></span>and a hint
      for a libel on the Court. The Duchess and Gay were offended at the proposition." It may be, however, that Pope thought it possible that such a poetical effusion as he had in mind might restore
      Gay to favour at Court. Gay, who received Pope's letter while he was on a visit to Orchard Wyndham, the seat of Sir William Wyndham, in Somersetshire, would do nothing in the matter, as will be
      seen from his reply.

        make me uneasy and dispirited, though not to any violent degree. The reception we met with, and the little excursions we made, were in every way agreeable. I think the country abounds with
        beautiful prospects. Sir William Wyndham is at present amusing himself with some real improvements, and a great many visionary castles. We are often entertained with sea-views, and sea fish,
        and were at some places in the neighbourhood, among which I was mightily pleased with Dunster Castle, near Minehead. It stands upon a great eminence, and has a prospect of that town, with an
        extensive view of the Bristol Channel, in which are seen two small islands, called the Steep Holms and Flat Holms, and on the other side we could plainly distinguish the divisions of fields
        on the Welsh coast. All this journey I performed on horseback, and I am very much disappointed that at present I feel myself so little the better for it. I have indeed followed riding and
        exercise for three months successively, and really think I was as well without it: so that I begin to fear the illness I have so long complained of, is inherent in my constitution, and that I

      Of Gay's posthumous works, there are several references in the correspondence of his friends. The first mention is concerning "Achilles," in a letter written from Twickenham by Pope to Caryll:
      "Poor Gay has gone before, and has not left an honester man behind him; he has just put a play into the house, which the Duke of Queensberry will take care of, and turn to the benefit of his
      relations. I have read it, and think it of his very best manner, a true original; he has left some other pieces fit for the press." Quite in keeping with his character Gay had made no
      arrangements for the disposal of the manuscripts he left behind him. "As to his writings, he left no will, nor spoke a word of them, or anything else, during his short and precipitate illness,
      in which I attended him to his last breath," Pope informed Swift, February 16th, 1733. "The Duke has acted more than the part of a brother to him, and it will be strange if the sisters do not
      leave his papers totally at his disposal, who will do the same that I would with them. He had managed the comedy (which our poor friend gave to the playhouse a week before his death) to the
      utmost advantage for his relations; and proposes to do the same with some Fables he left unfinished."<a name='FNanchor_12_179'></a><a href='#Footnote_12_179'><sup>[12]</sup></a> The play was
      much discussed in advance of its representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page142'>[pg 142]</a></span>Mr. Gay has left a posthumous work, which is soon to be acted," Lady Anne Irvine wrote to Lord Carlisle on January 6th, 1733. "Tis in
      the manner of 'The Beggar's Opera,' interspersed with songs; the subject is Achilles among the women, where he is discovered choosing a sword. The design is to ridicule Homer's Odysses; 'tis
      much commended, and I don't doubt, from the nature of the subject, will be much approved."<a name='FNanchor_13_180'></a><a href='#Footnote_13_180'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Gay's play was put into

      "The Distrest Wife," another of the posthumous plays, was a poor thing, and Swift was much annoyed that it was staged. "As to our poor friend, I think the Duke of <span class="newpage"><a name=
      'Page143'>[pg 143]</a></span>Queensberry has acted a very noble and generous part," Swift wrote to Pope, March 31st, 1734. "But before he did it, I wish there had been so much cunning used as to
      have let the sisters know that he expected they would let him dispose of Mr. Gay's writings as himself and other friends should advise. And I heartily wish his Grace had entirely stifled that
      comedy, if it were possible, than do an injury to our friend's reputation, only to get a hundred or two pounds to a couple of, perhaps, insignificant women. It has been printed here, and I am
      grieved to say it is a very poor performance. I have often chid Mr. Gay for not varying his schemes, but still adhering to those he had exhausted; and I much doubt whether the posthumous Fables
      will prove equal to the first. I think it is incumbent upon you to see that nothing more be published of his that will lessen his reputation for the sake of adding a few pounds to his sisters,
      who have already got so much by his death." "The Distrest Wife" was produced at Covent Garden Theatre on March 5th, 1734,<a name='FNanchor_17_184'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_17_184'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry were present at the performance. "To-morrow will be acted a new play of our friend Mr. Gay's; we stay on purpose
      now for that," the Duchess wrote to Swift on the previous day.<a name='FNanchor_18_185'></a><a href='#Footnote_18_185'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The play was published in 1743, and a second edition

    </p>
    <p>
      In a humorous piece, "The Rehearsal at Goatham," published in 1754, which was written probably about 1729, Gay ventilated his grievance against Walpole and the rest, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of
      the suppression of "Polly." This was Gay's King Charles's Head, and he never forgave the Minister for this, or for not finding him a place. He made an attack on him, obvious to all, in "The
      Vulture, the Sparrow, and Other Birds," which was included in his <span class="newpage"><a name='Page144'>[pg 144]</a></span>second series of "Fables"<a name='FNanchor_20_187'></a><a href=

      The devotion of Gay's friends survived his death, and they vied with one another in paying tribute to his memory. "As to himself, he knew the world too well to regret leaving it; and the world
      in general knew him too little to value him as they ought,"<a name='FNanchor_21_188'></a><a href='#Footnote_21_188'><sup>[21]</sup></a> the Duchess of Queensberry wrote to Swift on February

      joy untold, or even told, unless to one so entirely in your interest as he was, who bore at least an equal share in every satisfaction or dissatisfaction which attended us. I am not in the
      spleen, though I write thus; on the contrary, it is a sort of pleasure to think over his good qualities: his loss was really great, but it is a satisfaction to have once known so good a man."
      Her affection endured until the end. Although she was then a very old woman, when "Polly" was produced at the Haymarket Theatre on June 19th, 1777, nothing would content her but she must be
      present. Within a few weeks, on the following July 17th, she passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bathurst, too, deplored the loss of Gay; he of whom the poet had written in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Bathurst impetuous, hastens to the coast.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Whom you and I strive who shall love the most.</span><br />

    <p>
      "<span class="newpage"><a name='Page145'>[pg 145]</a></span>Poor John Gay!" he wrote to Swift on March 29th, 1733. "We shall see him no more; but he will always be remembered by those who knew
      him, with a tender concern." Arbuthnot, who also had had tribute paid him in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece":&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Arbuthnot there I see, in physic's art,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As Galen learned or famed Hippocrate;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Whose company drives sorrow from the heart</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As all disease his medicines dissipate.</span><br />

    <p>
      knew him well and loved him deeply. "We have all had another loss of our worthy and dear friend, Mr. Gay," he wrote to Swift on January 13th, 1733. "It was some alleviation of my grief to see
      him so universally lamented by almost everybody, even by those who knew him only by reputation. He was interred at Westminster Abbey, as if he had been a peer of the realm; and the good Duke of
      Queensberry, who lamented him as a brother, will set up a handsome monument upon him. These are little affronts put upon vice and injustice, and is all that remains in our power. I believe 'The
      Beggar's Opera,' and what he had to come upon the stage, will make the sum of the diversions of the town for some time to come."<a name='FNanchor_22_189'></a><a href=
      '#Footnote_22_189'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      By virtue of their fame, towering high above the rest of the select band of Gay's dearest friends, were Pope and Swift:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Blest be the great! for those they take away,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And those they left me; for they left me Gay,</span><br />

    <p>
      Pope had written in the "Epistle to Arbuthnot"; and Gay, as has been said, had more than once entered the lists and broken a lance on his brother poet's behalf, as when he parodied Ambrose
      Philips in "The Shepherd's Week." His "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece," written when Pope had finished his translation of the "Iliad," was a fine panegyric, in which he had a sly dig at the
      rival editor:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Tickell, whose skiff (in partnership they say)</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Set forth for Greece, but founder'd on the way.</span><br />

    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name='Page146'>[pg 146]</a></span>and in his "Epistle to the Right Honourable Paul Methuen, Esq.," he pilloried one of his friend's most violent critics:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had Pope with grovelling numbers fill'd his page,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Dennis had never kindled into rage.</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>'Tis the sublime that hurt the critic's ease;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Write nonsense, and he reads and sleeps in peace.</span><br />

    <p>
      "You say truly," Pope wrote to Swift, on April 2nd, 1733, "that death is only terrible to us as it separates us from those we love; but I really think those have the worst of it who are left by
      us, if we are true friends. I have felt more (I fancy) in the loss of Mr. Gay, than I shall suffer in the thought of going away myself into a state that none of us can feel this sort of losses.
      I wished vehemently to have seen him in a condition of living independent, and to have lived in perfect indolence the rest of our days together, the two most idle, most innocent, undesigning
      poets of our age."<a name='FNanchor_23_190'></a><a href='#Footnote_23_190'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the long years Gay was present to the minds of these, his dearest friends. "Dr. Arbuthnot's daughter is like Gay, very idle, very ingenuous, and inflexibly honest,"<a name=
      'FNanchor_24_191'></a><a href='#Footnote_24_191'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Pope wrote to Swift, May 17th, 1739; and two years earlier, on July 23rd, 1737, Swift had written to Erasmus Lewis: "I have
      had my share of affliction in the loss of Dr. Arbuthnot, and poor Gay, and others.<a name='FNanchor_25_192'></a><a href='#Footnote_25_192'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Such devotion, from such very
      different people puts it beyond question that Gay was a very lovable creature. How deeply he returned that devotion it is difficult to say&mdash;gratitude he felt, no doubt, but of love ... a
      man of such weak character, a man so devoted to the fleshpots, probably received more than he could give." Perhaps Swift, whose affections never blinded his intelligence, had some inkling of
      this when he said in the "Verses on His Own Death,"
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Poor Pope will grieve a month, and Gay</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>A week, and Arbuthnot a day.</span><br />

    <p>
      <span class="newpage"><a name='Page147'>[pg 147]</a></span>When Gay, in "Mr. Pope's Welcome from Greece," wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Thou, too, my Swift, dost breathe Boeotian air,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>When will thou bring back wit and humour here?</span><br />

    <p>
      the formal tribute is agreeable, but in this set of verses, while there is much that is complimentary, there is something perfunctory about the tributes he paid. He wrote of Pope and Swift and
      the rest as witty or humorous or generous or clever or learned or honest of mind: they wrote of the love they bore him. The two great literary giants took him under their wing, bore with his
      foibles, humoured him, championed him, and to the utmost of their power sought to protect their weaker brother of the pen from the rude buffetings of life.

        The "Advertisement" to the volume was as follows: "These Fables were finished by Mr. Gay, and intended for the Press, a short time before his death, when they were left, with his other
        papers, to the care of his noble friend and patron, the Duke of Queensberry. His Grace has accordingly permitted them to the Press, and they are here printed from the originals in the
        author's handwriting. We hope they will please equally with his former Fables, though mostly on subjects of a graver and more political turn. They will certainly show him to have been (what
        he esteemed the best character) a man of true honest heart, and a sincere lover of his country."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
